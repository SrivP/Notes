could be classified as &ldquo;the rise of the connected note-taking app.&rdquo; In the past year,
<a href=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps rel=noopener>Roam Research raised $9 million dollars (with a $200 million valuation) </a>,
<a href=https://www.producthunt.com/stories/announcing-the-2020-golden-kitty-award-winners rel=noopener>Obsidian was nominated for the Product Hunt Golden Kitty award from for the Productivity category</a>, and countless other note-taking apps entered the productivity space with their own version of bidirectional linking features.
<a href=https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/cross-linking rel=noopener>Even Drafts got an update which allows wiki-style cross-linking</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time for thinkers and creators.</p><p>While there are lots of apps doing lots of interesting things with notes right now, by far the two most popular options are <em>Roam Research</em> and <em>Obsidian</em>. In this article, we&rsquo;re going to compare these two connected note-takers and help you choose the right one.</p><a href=#the-approach><h2 id=the-approach><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Approach</h2></a><p>It&rsquo;s impossible to say &ldquo;just use this one&rdquo; when it comes to picking the right connected note-taking app for you. On the surface they may seem similar, but there are several important differences that stem from fundamentally different approaches to how your notes are stored and managed.</p><p>There are lots of things you can look at when picking your PKM app, but here are the criteria we used:</p><ul><li>User Interface</li><li>Graph View</li><li>Daily Notes</li><li>Backlinks</li><li>Sidebar</li><li>Block Embeds/References</li><li>Markdown Support</li><li>Search/Query</li><li>Daily Notes</li><li>Tasks</li><li>Expandability</li><li>Theming</li><li>Data Portability</li><li>Publishing</li><li>Data Security</li><li>Mobile Experience</li><li>Pricing</li></ul><p>In this article, we&rsquo;re going to carefully consider the design choices each app makes in these categories and do our level best to help you pick the right PKM app to fit your workflow.</p><a href=#user-interface><h2 id=user-interface><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>User Interface</h2></a><p>The user interface is arguably the most important aspect of a note-taking app, making it easy (or unnecessarily difficult) to capture your ideas and thoughts when you have them.</p><a href=#obsidian><h3 id=obsidian><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>As a pure note-taking app, Obsidian&rsquo;s interface can be confusing. There are a couple of sidebars and a whole bunch of buttons that can get in the way of capturing text into your Obsidian vault.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidian.jpg alt></p><p>Once you understand the interface, this really isn&rsquo;t a problem. But I&rsquo;ve watched more than one person open Obsidian for the first time and immediately close the app because it looked too complicated.</p><p>When working with text in Obsidian, there are two different modes you will switch between:</p><ul><li><em>Edit Mode</em> where you write your text</li><li><em>Preview Mode</em> where you can view the result of your Markdown-formatted text</li></ul><p>You can switch modes by clicking the icon in the top-right of the document pane, but if you switch back and forth a lot this can be a little tedious. You can actually hold the <em>Command</em> key when you click on the Preview icon to open the preview in a new pane, which gives you a side-by-side view of your note.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiansidebyside.jpg alt></p><p>I actually prefer to write this way as the preview gets updated in real-time. But it&rsquo;s not entirely discoverable for a brand new user.</p><a href=#roam><h3 id=roam><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>The user interface is where Roam Research really shines. It has a clever way of displaying the raw text when you click on a line, then rendering the preview when you switch the focus to another line.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamresearch.jpg alt></p><p>This is a great way to work with your text, and eliminates a lot of the friction if you do more than just text.</p><p>Roam also includes a section at the bottom of each note which shows the backlinks, making them more easily discoverable for new users. We&rsquo;ll dig deeper into backlinks in the next section, but it&rsquo;s worth calling out here because being able to see and link related pages is an important of the user interface and Roam does this better.</p><a href=#winner-roam><h3 id=winner-roam><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Roam</h3></a><a href=#graph-view><h2 id=graph-view><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Graph View</h2></a><p>The <em>Graph</em> is kind of like a mind map, showing all of the connections between all of the notes. It can be useful to help see links between notes and ideas, but can also be overwhelming when you have a lot of notes.</p><a href=#obsidian-1><h3 id=obsidian-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>Obsidian&rsquo;s graph view is incredible. Not only is it super-fast, but you can apply filters, create groups, and even change the look and functionality of the graph itself:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiangraph.jpg alt></p><p>But the real magic in Obsidian happens in the local graph.</p><p>You can open a local graph by clicking on the three dots in the upper-right of the active note and selecting <em>Open local graph</em> from the menu. This opens a simpler graph which shows the notes in your vault that link to the active note, and the notes that the active note links to. These bidirectional links allow you to navigate between your notes by clicking on the dots in the local graph.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianlocalgraph.jpg alt></p><p>The local graph automatically updates when you open a new active note, and it can be stored in the sidebar so you can access it quickly.</p><a href=#roam-1><h3 id=roam-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>The <em>Graph Overview</em> in Roam gives you a look at the connections between all the notes in you library, but is completely unusable if you have a large number of notes. You can see the connections when you hover over a circle for a specific note, but they seem to be randomly spaced and there isn&rsquo;t a great way to navigate between them.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamgraph.png alt></p><p>There are also no filters to help clean up the Graph overview, and it&rsquo;s much slower in our testing than the Graph View in Obsidian.</p><p>Roam does have a button on each note page that you can click to &ldquo;Open a graph of this page in the sidebar,&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t update as you navigate through your notes. It is literally a static graph view of the current note and the links between other notes in your Roam database. While it can serve it&rsquo;s purpose, we feel the Graph View in Obsidian is much more polished - and much more useful.</p><a href=#winner-obsidian><h3 id=winner-obsidian><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Obsidian</h3></a><a href=#backlinks><h2 id=backlinks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Backlinks</h2></a><p>Backlinks are the foundation of a connected note-taking app, allowing you to navigate between your notes like a personal wiki. Both Roam and Obsidian take this wiki-style linking a step further though, allowing you to surface <em>unlinked mentions</em> of your currently selected note and make connections with a click. This allows you to intentionally connect your notes in new and more meaningful ways, which can be especially useful for creatives who want to develop their ideas.</p><a href=#obsidian-2><h3 id=obsidian-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>Linking to pages in Obsidian is simple: just use <code>[[pagetitle]]</code> anywhere in your text to add a link to the note with that page title. Obsidian&rsquo;s auto-complete helps you find the page you want to link to, or you can create a link to new page by entering a text string that doesn&rsquo;t currently exist in a note title. You can click on these links to navigate to that page when in Preview mode, and the connection also shows up in the graph view.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianautocomplete.jpg alt></p><p>You can also use Obsidian&rsquo;s auto-complete to link to headers in the document by using <code>#</code>, or link to a specific block by using <code>^</code>.</p><p>The problem with backlinks in Obsidian lies in how it handles unlinked mentions. Backlinks (linked mentions and unlinked mentions) are both located in the sidebar and easy to miss. Once you know where to look it&rsquo;s not a big deal, but we prefer the way Roam puts backlinks at the bottom of the note.</p><a href=#roam-2><h3 id=roam-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Just like Obsidian, Roam allows you to create a ink to another page using <code>[[pagetite]]</code>. The big difference is the addition of the linked mentions and unlinked mentions at the bottom of your currently selected note. This may seem like a small detail, but it makes finding and creating links incredibly easy in Roam since it&rsquo;s hard to miss. And the more that you use intentionally link your notes together, the more valuable your web of ideas becomes.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/autocompleteroam.jpg alt></p><p>Roam also does a <em>much</em> better job handling backlinks to individual blocks. Unlike Obsidian (which uses individual text files), Roam is a database. This means that each individual block in Roam is it&rsquo;s own entry in the database, and makes it much easier to link atomic note elements together. We&rsquo;ll dig into this in the next section on block references, but Roam is built to make the most of this essential feature.</p><a href=#winner-roam-1><h3 id=winner-roam-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Roam</h3></a><a href=#sidebar><h2 id=sidebar><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sidebar</h2></a><p>Another important part of the user interface is the <em>sidebar</em>. This can display related information to the note you&rsquo;re currently editing and serve as a collecting place for related notes that you want to view together.</p><a href=#obsidian-3><h3 id=obsidian-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>The sidebar in Obsidian is where much of the magic happens. It can not only show you the linked and unlinked mentions for the note you are currently editing, but can also do things like display an outline of your note broken down by header and give you quick access to your tags. You can even keep a local graph in the sidebar of linked notes that updates when you open a new note.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiansidebar.jpg alt></p><p>Using third-party plugins can extend the sidebar capabilities even further. For example, the Calendar plugin allows you to navigate a calendar view and quickly jump to Daily Notes pages for a specific date. Plugins are a whole separate section, but they can extend the capabilities of the sidebar in Obsidian in some really cool ways/</p><a href=#roam-3><h3 id=roam-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>The sidebar in Roam serves a little bit of a different purpose. Instead of panes where you can choose what information you want to show, the primary role of the sidebar in Roam is to serve as a collecting place for related information. For example, hold the <em>Shift</em> key while you click a link and the note opens in the sidebar instead of navigating away from the note you are currently on.</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsidebar.jpg alt></p><p>Putting related notes int he sidebar also makes it easier when you want to embed a block from one note into another one. Just hold down the <em>Option</em> key and drag the block from the sidebar into the note in the main window and the block will be embedded automatically.</p><p>The big difference here is that the sidebar in Roam has a very specific function: to aid you in your research. The design choices about the sidebar reflect this: the sidebar is for the bits and pieces, the main window is for your active note. There is no such distinction in Obsidian, but the flexibility it gives you in designing your sidebar layout makes up for this in time. While there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for Roam&rsquo;s focused simplicity, when you start extending Obsidian&rsquo;s capabilities using plugins the sidebar becomes an essential tool</p><a href=#winner-roam-2><h3 id=winner-roam-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Roam</h3></a><a href=#block-embedsreferences><h2 id=block-embedsreferences><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Block Embeds/References</h2></a><p>Occasionally, you might want to link to a specific section of a note. These fundamental building blocks of notes are called <em>blocks</em>, and being able to link and embed them in other notes is a powerful benefit of connected note-taking apps.</p><a href=#obsidian-4><h3 id=obsidian-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>To embed something in Obsidian, you simply put an <code>!</code> character before the <code>[[pagetitle]]</code>. This tells Obsidian that instead of just linking to the page, you want to embed it in the current location in the active note. You can take this even further by using a <code>#</code> to embed a specific header or <code>^</code> to embed a specific block. Using auto-complete like this make block embeds in Obsidian even easier than they are in Roam.</p><p>Linking and embedding blocks is kind of a hacky workaround in Obsidian. Since it&rsquo;s based on individual text files, the way Obsidian connects to individual blocks is to add a weird identifier at the end of the block that it can use to locate it again:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianbolck.jpg alt></p><p>This is fine for embedding blocks into other notes. Where this really falls down though is with block references.</p><p>Unfortunately, the only way to see block references is in the backlinks section in the sidebar. This isn&rsquo;t a problem if you have very small (atomic) notes in your Obsidian vault, but it gets tricky if you have longer notes with lots of blocks you&rsquo;d like to reference in other notes. Instead of quickly being able to find the few notes that reference a specific block in a list, you have to comb through <em>all</em> the links to the entire page.</p><p>This is Obsidian&rsquo;s achilee&rsquo;s heel, and forces you to keep a large number of short notes in your vault instead of a small number of large notes. You can work around it, but it&rsquo;s annoying.</p><a href=#roam-4><h3 id=roam-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Block embeds and references in Roam are easy. Because everything in Roam is stored in a database, there is no distinction between individual notes and blocks and everything can be broken down into more atomic units.</p><p>You can use a block reference in Roam by:</p><ul><li>Using <code>((</code> and searching your database for the block you want to link</li><li>Right-clicking on a block and selecting <em>Copy Block Reference</em></li><li>Dragging a block from a note in your sidebar into the main note window</li></ul><p>Because Roam converts text to preview the moment you deselect the line, a block reference in Roam looks very much like a block embed in Obsidian. It shows you the contents of the original block, but if you go back to the original block you will also see a number to the right of the block. This indicates the number of references to the block in your entire Roam Research database, and clicking on it will show all references in line:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamblock.jpg alt></p><p>This is incredibly useful, and a major reason to choose Roam Research for your PKM needs. The more you use block references like this, the more powerful you realize this feature is.</p><p>Block Embeds in Roam are also better than they are in Obsidian, allowing you created a linked copy of the block in the current note. The difference here is that instead of merely pointing back to the original block and displaying the contents, a block embed allows you to edit the contents of the block right in your new note. When you do, the original block (and all other embedded copies of the block) are updated as well.</p><a href=#winner-roam-3><h3 id=winner-roam-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Roam</h3></a><a href=#markdown-support><h2 id=markdown-support><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Markdown Support</h2></a><p>Both apps support Markdown formatting in plain text.

Most of it will be familiar (i.e. <code>#</code> for headers, bulleted lists, etc.), but it also inexplicably changes some very familiar Markdown formatting. For example, standard Markdown lets you use <code>**</code> (or <code>__</code>) for bold and <code>*</code> (or <code>_</code>) for italic formatting. But in Roam, you have to use <code>**</code> for bold and <code>__</code> for italic. This goes directly against the standard Markdown convention of double characters for bold text and single for italic.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the Roam team made this choice. You can argue that you&rsquo;ll just get used to it, but not if you do writing in any other plain text editors that support standard Markdown formatting. This is inexcusable, and a dealbreaker for many.</p><a href=#winner-obsidian-1><h3 id=winner-obsidian-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Obsidian</h3></a><a href=#searchquery><h2 id=searchquery><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Search/Query</h2></a><p>Search used to be the only practical way to surface your notes after you had captured them. This has changed with the advent of bidirectional linking in connected note-taking apps, but search is still useful when you need to locate something specific.

Queries require a specific formatting to be used, but are incredibly powerful because they embed the blocks that match your criteria in the page. For example, a simple query that return everything with a tag of <code>#Quote</code> looks something like this:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsearch.jpg alt></p><p>In addition to search and queries, Roam also has <em>Filters</em> that can limit what data you see when looking at your note.

Daily Notes are the digital equivalent of the Bullet Journal&rsquo;s daily page, serving as a place to capture bits and pieces of information before you process them and decide where they belong.</p><a href=#obsidian-7><h3 id=obsidian-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Obsidian</h3></a><p>If you open a fresh install of Obsidian, you won&rsquo;t see the Daily Notes feature as it&rsquo;s not on by default. It must be enabled by going to <strong>Settings &ndash;> Core Plugins</strong> and toggling on <strong>Daily Notes</strong>. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage, as it&rsquo;s not on by default but also allows you to limit the features you don&rsquo;t use to keep Obsidian from getting unwieldy.</p><p>Once you have Daily Notes enabled, an icon will appear on the left sidebar that you can click to go straight to today&rsquo;s Daily Note:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiandailynotes.jpg alt></p><p>This opens up today&rsquo;s daily note, and you can capture text that gets linked to that specific date.</p><p>And out of the box, that&rsquo;s all it does.

<a href=https://thesweetsetup.com/journaling-using-daily-questions-in-obsidian/ rel=noopener>like I do for journaling</a>.</p><p>The big limitation with Obsidian&rsquo;s Daily Notes is in the way it surfaces tasks (or rather doesn&rsquo;t). We look at tasks in another section, but Daily Notes are an important piece to task management and it&rsquo;s a little bit lacking in Obsidian. You can link tasks to a specific date, but because they aren&rsquo;t displayed in the main note it&rsquo;s very easy to miss them.</p><a href=#roam-7><h3 id=roam-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Daily Notes are a very important part of the Roam Research experience.

<a href=https://thesweetsetup.com/how-i-use-roam-research-for-journaling/ rel=noopener>very interesting journaling workflows</a>.</p><p>By opening to today&rsquo;s daily note, Roam also makes it a better option for managing tasks than Obsidian. In addition to showing linked tasks (the ones due that day) on the main note in the linked mentions section, it also shows that day first thing when you open the app so you don&rsquo;t miss them. Of course, that still assumes you are opening the app every day.</p><a href=#winner-roam-5><h3 id=winner-roam-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Roam</h3></a><a href=#tasks><h2 id=tasks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tasks</h2></a><p>Plain text task management is nothing new.

But there are lots of third-party plugins that try to fix this in lots of different ways, like:</p><ul><li>the Slated plugin which adds a bunch of additional features to task management in Obsidian</li><li>the Todoist plugin that allows you to embed tasks from Todoist using filters</li><li>the Kanban plugin which allows you to create cards for your tasks and link to pages from the card titles</li></ul><p>But the vanilla Obsidian app leaves a lot to be desired.</p><a href=#roam-8><h3 id=roam-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Roam seems to be built with task management in mind. From any block, you can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Command + Enter</strong> to cycle between a todo, a completed todo, and a plain text block.

While some features in Obsidian may use special formatting, the foundation of your notes documents is standard Markdown that can be opened and edited in any other plain text editor.</p><p>In terms of futureproofing, it doesn&rsquo;t get any safer than this.</p><a href=#roam-11><h3 id=roam-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Roam also uses plain text, but stores it in a proprietary database format.

That might not be such a big deal, except that when you share a note in Roan, <em>all of the data in your entire graph gets loaded in your visitor&rsquo;s browser</em>. There&rsquo;s even a warning if you toggle on the setting for sharing individual pages:</p><p><img src=https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsharing.jpg alt></p><p>The alternative is to make your entire graph public, but if you keep notes on things you don&rsquo;t want to share with the world you&rsquo;ll need to keep that info in a separate graph (meaning it&rsquo;s unlinkable from the graph that you share).</p><p>Like Obsidian, Roam also doesn&rsquo;t have a way to publish directly to Wordpress. But it also doesn&rsquo;t use standard Markdown, which means you can&rsquo;t simply copy and paste either. It seems like the Roam team is focused on developing more multi-user features, but at the moment it&rsquo;s not a great publishing or sharing platform for most people.</p><a href=#winner-obsidian-4><h3 id=winner-obsidian-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Obsidian</h3></a><a href=#data-security><h2 id=data-security><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Data Security</h2></a><p>Your notes should be private unless you decide to share them.

For example, I keep my vault in my Dropbox folder, which allows me to access my notes in apps like 1Writer. Because Dropbox sync is so solid, any changes are instantly sent back to my Mac and instantly show up in Obsidian.</p><p>There is also an iOS app in development, but it is currently in closed beta as of this writing. It&rsquo;s amazingly functional and very solid for such a young app, but early signs indicate this could be a very pleasant iOS experience for Obsidian users - assuming that they are willing to pay for Obsidian Sync to keep their vault up-to-date between their different devices.</p><a href=#roam-14><h3 id=roam-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Roam Research is not made for mobile access.

Quick Capture lets you jot down text, todos, links, and images and add them as blocks directly to your Daily Notes pages so you can process them when you get back to your computer. You can choose the graph you want and select the page you want to add the block to, but it&rsquo;s really just for capturing things on the go.</p><p>Bottom line: if you want to access your notes from your iPhone, Roam isn&rsquo;t a great option.</p><a href=#winner-obsidian-6><h3 id=winner-obsidian-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Obsidian</h3></a><a href=#pricing><h2 id=pricing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pricing</h2></a><p>While we all love a good deal, ultimately you want to make sure that the connected note-taker you decide to use has a clear business model that can support future development.

That would normally make us a little nervous, but Obsidian has a very clear monetization strategy by offering add-ons for purchase.</p><p>There are currently two different add-ons available for Obsidian:</p><ul><li><em>Publish</em>, which allows you to share your notes publicly via the web for $8/month (current pricing, paid annually)</li><li><em>Sync</em>,which allows you to access your vault on your mobile devices and includes 1 year of revision history for $4/month (current pricing, paid annually)</li></ul><p>Both of these services are well implemented, and allow users who need them to support Obsidian&rsquo;s development. Note that these add-ons are <em>not</em> the same as the plugins mentioned earlier, which are accessible in the free version. And if you don&rsquo;t need Sync or Publish but just want to support the Obsidian team, you can do that as well via the web.</p><a href=#roam-15><h3 id=roam-15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Roam</h3></a><p>Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way: Roam is <em>really</em> expensive.</p><p>There is no free version of Roam, and pricing begins at $15/month for the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; version. If you decide to pay yearly it&rsquo;s $165, and there is a &ldquo;Believer&rdquo; plan that is $500 for 5 years. The Pro version includes a 30 day free trial (you get charged on day 31), but it&rsquo;s a pretty big investment. By comparison, if you signed up for both the Sync and Publish add-ons using current pricing, you&rsquo;d be paying $144/year for Obsidian.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to make a blanket statement about whether Roam&rsquo;s hefty price tag is worth it. If you&rsquo;re all in with Roam it probably is. But if you&rsquo;re just getting started with connected note-taking and dipping your toes in the PKM waters, it&rsquo;s hard to justify.</p><a href=#winner-obsidian-7><h3 id=winner-obsidian-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Winner: Obsidian</h3></a></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://orca2.netlify.app/js/graph.5388a070919094961d3e5151252e9065.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Orca using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>The cool guy who made Quartz</a></li><li><a href=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/>How set up in case I forget</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
