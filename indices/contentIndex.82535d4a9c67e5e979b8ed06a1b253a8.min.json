What do you think about while listening to it?\n\t\t- It brings to mind this idea of moving forward with life, at first it sounds like a poem describing a desolate landscape, but when you look into it more, you start to notice that it's more about moving on. Because like when the author uses words like \"How charged with punishments the scroll\", it comes to mind that punishments are warranted when you did something wrong. But in the final line, where he states \"I am master of my fate, I am captain of my soul\", it gives us this sense of moving forward.\n\t3.

Does the poet bring up ideas you'd like to ask him/her about?\n\t\t- I've always had this idea of guilt and forgiveness, they're polar opposities, but they share a symbiotic relationship. If you are guilty, you need to forgive yourself to let go of the guilt, but if you're forgiving too much, then it can cause guilt in others. For example, if you snuck in a few cookies from the cookie jar without telling your parents, you feel guilty (sometimes), so to move on, would be to tell your parents, or \"forgive yourself\" and move on. But lets take for example, you are on a diet, and you eat a cookie. It goes against your diet, you forgive yourself, but that will make you want to do it again. That will make you more guilty. Its a weird relationship. But they relate together. So i would like to ask the author, how should one move on from the problems they face and forgive without guilt?.\n\t \n- Second Try:\n\t- 1.  What do you think about while reading the poem?\n\t\t- It brings to mind this idea of moving forward with life, at first it sounds like a poem describing a desolate landscape, but when you look into it more, you start to notice that it's more about moving on. Because like when the author uses words like \"How charged with punishments the scroll\", it comes to mind that punishments are warranted when you did something wrong. But in the final line, where he states \"I am master of my fate, I am captain of my soul\", it gives us this sense of moving forward, and making sure no matter the number of punishments or insults, you shouldn't give \"bow\" to the problem, but stand your ground.\n\t2. Where did your mind go?\n\t\t- My mind went to a dark room, a place where one can reflect on their past, without distraction\n\t3. Has anything been said in the poem to remind you of something in your life?\n\t\t- Though this isn't the main idea, the poem reminds me of a time in my life where I had to face bullying. So for a bit of context, when i first came to Canada, I live first at British Columbia, langley. While there I had a light accent in the way i spoke, so during my time there, my accent was often criticized, and I was often isolated at school. But even through all the bullying i faced, I was often unhinged, this related directly to the poem since multiple line talk about how the speaker's head never bows, and how he has an unconquerable soul.
