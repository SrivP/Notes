In this article, we're going to show you how to install community plugins if you're not familiar with the process and share some of our favorites.\n\n## How to Install Plugins in Obsidian\n\nThere are two kinds of plugins in Obsidian:\n\n- *Core plugins* that ship with the app\n- *Community plugins* developed by others\n\nThe community plugins are where a lot of the magic happens.\n\nTo access the plugins, click on the *Settings* button in the left sidebar. Click on *Community plugins*, and toggle off Safe Mode. Then click on *Browse* and you'll be taken to the Community plugin directory:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/directory.jpg)\n\nTo install a plugin:\n1. Click the plugin you want to install from the list on the left\n2. Click the *Install* button\n3. Click the *Enable* button\n\nYour plugin is now installed and ready to be used.\n\nYou can also toggle individual plugins on and off once they are installed at the bottom of the *Settings--\u003e Community plugins* screen.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pluginsactive.jpg)\n\nNow that you know how to install community plugins, let's look at some of our favorites.\n\n## A Few of Our Favorite Plugins\n\nOut of all the plugins we've tried, these are the ones we consider to be the best of the bunch. Keep in mind that these plugins are being updated and new ones are being added all the time, so you may want to check the directory frequently to see what's new.\n\n### Kanban\n\nI use the [Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) to track all of my writing projects, and link to the individual cards for each article that I'm currently writing. You can even link the cards in the plugin as tasks to your Daily Notes using a date-picker. Here's what it looks like:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kanban1.jpg)\n\nThis screenshot doesn't really do the plugin justice as ever card is draggable between the different swim lanes. There's even a setting for automatically marking the task as complete when dragging it to the *Done* column. But behind all the functionality this plugin gives you, the file itself is still just a basic Markdown-formatted text file:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kanban2.jpg)\n\nThis is my favorite plugin, hands down. I can't recommend it enough. And if you want to read more about how I use it, check out [[Mike's Obsidian-Based Writing Workflow]].\n\n### Calendar\n\nThe Calendar plugin is currently the most popular plugin in the Obsidian directory, and with good reason. It gives you an easy way to jump between dates for your Daily Notes by giving you a clickable calendar view in your sidebar.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/calendar.jpg)\n\nTo jump to a specific date, just click on it in the calendar view. If the date doesn't exist yet, it will prompt you to create a new Daily Note in the appropriate location. Dots appear under each day to indicate the amount of text in the note and whether there are any unfinished tasks linked to that date.\n\nIf you're going to use Daily Notes in Obsidian, you need the Calendar plugin. It's that simple.\n\n### Review\n\nSpeaking of Daily Notes, the [Review plugin](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/review-obsidian) can help you remember to review notes on specific days. You do this by activating the Command Palette (Command-P) and selecting **Review: Add this note to a daily note for review** from the desired note. This creates a second-level header at the bottom of the Daily Note for the desired date and adds a link back to the original note:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/review.jpg)\n\nThis plugin uses natural language to determine the next review (i.e. \"Next Friday\"), so it also requires a separate [Natural Language Dates plugin](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian). Just be aware it may not quite work exactly as expected until you install and activate both of these plugins.\n\nFor those interested in the concept of spaced repetition, this one is essential.\n\n### Vantage\n\nQueries are a bit of a hidden power user feature in Obsidian, but they don't have to be. With the [Vantage plugin](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/vantage-obsidian), you can construct powerful search queries without needing to know all of the syntax Just active Vantage from the Command Palette (Command-P) and select **Vantage - advanced search builder: Build a new search**. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vantage.jpg)\n\nHere's the code that creating an embedded search based on the screenshot above adds to the current note:\n\n```query\nfile:(2021-06-10 OR 2021-06-11 OR 2021-06-12 OR 2021-06-13 OR 2021-06-14 OR 2021-06-15 OR 2021-06-16 OR 2021-06-17 OR 2021-06-18) path:(PKM Course)  (line:(/- \\[ \\].*record.*/)) ((/- [^[.]].*\\[\\[.*Vantage.*\\]\\].*/))\n```\n\nBut the beautiful part about all of this is that *you don't need to understand any of that code.* You can build you queries in Vantage and the plugin translates everything for you.\n\n### Note Refactor\n\nIn the [Zero-to-Obsidian workshop](https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian/), I explained the importance of what I call *atomic notes*. The basic idea is to break your notes apart into smaller chunks in order to make the most out of the bidirectional links in Obsidian. So for example, in the screenshot below I have the Atomic Habits note open on the right, and a separate note that I broke out as it's own note (The 4 Laws of Behavior Change) on the left:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/noterefactor.jpg)\n\nNotice the link on the Atomic Habits page to the 4 Laws page. That's important.\n\nWhat the [Note Refactor plugin](https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian) does is take a selection of text and break it out as it's own note while simultaneously putting a link into the original note that points to the new one. This makes a bidirectional link between the two notes and is visible in the local graph in the upper-right. \n\nThere's lots of different formatting options you can use with this, but it's an essential tool for build a library of atomic notes. \n\n*Update: You can now do this using a Core plugin that you can read about in [[Splitting Notes in Obsidian]]. But Note Refactor is still the power user tool of choice.*\n\n### Better Word Count\n\nObsidian ships with a core plugin for word count, but the [Better Word Count plugin](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count) is, well, *better*. It gives you options to toggle on or off the number of words, characters, and sentences, lets you customize the descriptors for each, and lets you count from a selection as well as the entire document.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/betterwordcount.jpg)\n\nIt's pretty simple as far as plugins go, but it makes Obsidian an even better writing tool. If you want to know more, check out [[Turning Obsidian into the Perfect Writing App]].\n\n### Todoist\n\nThe [Todoist plugin](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin) allows you to embed interactive Todoist tasks into an Obsidian note. The syntax for this plugin is based on Todoist's powerful web filters, which allows you to embed tasks that meet certain criteria. For example, here's a simple query for the book publishing checklist I have in Todoist embedded in Obsidian:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/todoist.jpg)\n\nOn the left is the actual code written in Edit Mode, and on the right is the interactive rendering of the Todoist tasks in Preview Mode. As you can see, the task names, projects, and even swim lanes are displayed in Obsidian. The colors come over from Todoist's priority levels, and each task is interactive so I can check the circle and mark it off as complete in Todoist.\n\nThis is a great plugin for anyone who keeps tasks in Todoist but wants a way to visualize those tasks alongside project information inside of Obsidian. If you want to see it in action, check out [[Syncing and Embedding Tasks with Todoist]].\n\n### Tracker\n\nThe [Tracker Plugin](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker) is the heart and soul of my [[Daily Questions in Obsidian]] journaling workflow. What it does is take values (in my case, numeric values associated with specific tags) and plots them on a graph. Here's a side-by-side screenshot of the code snippets in Edit Mode and what it looks like rendered in Preview Mode:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tracker.jpg)\n\nMy use case is pretty basic: I assign values daily to the tags on a scale of 1-10 using my Daily Notes for journaling, then Tracker collects all of those and plots them on individual graphs by tag. But there's a lot more you can do with with the Tracker plugin if you're willing to devote a little bit of time to figure out how to make it work.\n\n### Dataview\n\nAnother great plugin for visualizing data is the [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), which turns your Obsidian vault into a  database with powerful query tools. For example, I have a note for every episode of the [Bookworm podcast](https://bookworm.fm/) I've recorded. Using YAML at the top of the document, I can apply individual values for both my rating and Joe's rating (my co-host) for the book that we covered. Then using Dataview, I can tabulate all those ratings and sort in a desired order. Here's a screenshot of the Dataview code in Edit Mode (which includes every note in the *Bookworm* folder and sorts them in descending order based on my rating) and the visualization of that code in Preview Mode:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview.jpg)\n\nI walk through the whole process in setting this up in [[YAML \u0026 Dataview]].\n\nThere's lots of other stuff you can do with this plugin. See [this thread in the Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-plugin-snippet-showcase/13673) for more inspiration.\n\n### Obsidian Git\n\n**WARNING! This one is super-nerdy.**\n\n[Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) is basically a backup plugin for Obsidian, but instead of creating a local backup of all your files it sends all your changes to a GitHub repository. In addition to a backup, this also gives you a sort of version control for your Obsidian vault. You can set it up backup automatically, or use a keyboard shortcut to manually trigger a push/pull.\n\nI learned the hard way that getting up Git on your Mac can be tricky. I don't really use Git much, so I enlisted the help of a friend who really understands this stuff. But if you're feeling adventurous, [here's a pretty good guide to getting started](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-i-put-my-mind-under-version-control-24caea37b8a5).","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Appending-Drafts-to-Dropbox-Daily-Notes-in-Obsidian":{"title":"Appending Drafts to Dropbox Daily Notes in Obsidian","content":"\n[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) has long been the place that text starts on my iOS device. But lately I've been doing a lot more in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and was looking for a way to get that text into Obsidian easily when I was done. While this is pretty straightforward using a cloud service like Dropbox to sync your vault, I then began wondering if I could do something more than just dump my text files in a synced folder.\n\nTurns out you can.\n\n## Why Append to Daily Notes?\n\nIf you're not familiar with the concept of *Daily Notes*, it's basically a feature you can enable that creates a new note for each day you open the Obsidian app. I previously shared [a video](https://thesweetsetup.com/journaling-using-daily-questions-in-obsidian) showing how I use this page for my daily journaling, but I know many people like to use these Daily Notes pages as the place to capture tasks, ideas, meeting notes, and the like. Backlinks make it easy to tie these notes to other related notes, so this is actually a pretty great workflow.\n\nThe problem is on iOS.\n\nWhile Obsidian does have iOS apps that are currently in private beta, they're not ideal for capturing for several reasons:\n\n1. Your vault needs to load when you open the app (takes several seconds)\n2. You have to navigate to the right note\n3. You have to navigate to the right spot in the note\n4. *THEN* you can capture your text.\n\nThat's too much friction for me. With Drafts, I can just open the app and start typing. And once I set up a Drafts export action to append the text to my Daily Note in Obsidian, I can simply tap a button and be done.\n\n*(BTW, if you want more info on Obsidian for iOS, check out [[Using Obsidian on iOS]].)*\n\n## Setting Up Obsidian\n\nBefore this will work correctly, you need to make sure Obsidian is set up correctly. There's a couple steps to this:\n\n1. You need to make sure your vault (folder containing all the text files Obsidian looks at) is synced to the cloud. Theoretically you can use any cloud service, but I prefer Dropbox for this.\n2. You need to make sure that *Daily Notes* are enabled (you can toggle this on by going to *Settings --\u003e Core Plugins --\u003e Daily Notes*).\n3. You need to make sure that the Daily Notes settings are using the *YYYY-MM-DD* format (this is what Drafts uses in it's date token).\n4. You need the folder for the *New File Location* (this is where we'll tell Drafts to look for the files). Note that this is a usually a subfolder inside your main vault folder.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidian1.jpg)\n\nOnce you have these settings, we can go set things up in Drafts.\n\n## Setting Up the Drafts Action\n\nThe export action is actually pretty simple, but requires some formatting. Here's how to set it up.\n\nFirst, open the Drafts export actions and tap the **+** button to create a new action, then select *New Action* (we're going to build this one from scratch).\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts1.jpg)\n\nNext, name the action and change the color and icon if you want to.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts2.jpg)\n\nTap on *Steps* and select the *Dropbox* step under *Services*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts3.jpg)\n\nNow you need to configure this step correctly. Here's the settings you want to use:\n\n1. The *Name* should be `[[date]].md`. The `[[date]]` is the Drafts date token, and .md is the file extension that Obsidian uses by default. This tells Drafts to look for the file `YYYY-MM-DD.md` as the target for our text.\n2. The *Path* must be set to your Daily Notes folder, relative to your Dropbox folder. For example, my Obsidian vault is located at /Users/XXXXXX/Dropbox/Notes/Daily Notes, so the path I use here is `/Notes/Daily Notes/`.\n3. The *Template* is what text will be sent. By default, the `[[draft]]` token will grab the entire text in Drafts and send it to the file.\n4. The *Write Type* should be set to *append*. This will place the text at the end of the Daily Note. If you prefer it appear at the beginning, you can use *prepend* instead.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts4.jpg)\n\nThat's it! Now tap *Save \u0026 Exit*, and you're ready to use your new export action.\n\n## Sending Text from Drafts to Obsidian\n\nNow you can type your text and send it to Obsidian. You can tap the Drafts icon in the upper-right and select your action, or use just tap the name of the action in the bar above the keyboard. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts5.jpg)\n\nWhatever text you type will be appended to the file in Dropbox and instantly show up in Obsidian.\n\nOne cool thing about this is that both Drafts and Obsidian can do special things on top of plain text. For example, if you want to send a task from Drafts to Obsidian, you could do that by using the plain text task formatting: a dash, followed by a space, then left and right brackets with a space in-between. Then when the text appears in Obsidian, you can switch to *Preview Mode* to interact with the task element and check it off. Here's a screenshot of Edit Mode and Preview Mode side-by-side using the default Obsidian theme:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidian2.jpg)\n\n## Bonus Nerdery\n\nIf you go back and edit the Drafts action, you can find  a couple of other cool options if you scroll down a bit:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/drafts6.jpg)\n\nFor example:\n\n- You can assign this action to an external keyboard shortcut\n- You can add the action to Siri\n- You can automatically archive or delete the text in Drafts once the action has been completed.\n\nI usually don't assign keyboard shortcuts because I'm primarily using Drafts on my iPhone, but I do like to automatically archive the text after it's been sent to Obsidian. This helps me keep my Drafts inbox a little more tidy.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Callback-URLs-in-Obsidian":{"title":"Callback URLs in Obsidian","content":"\nOne of the things I love about Obsidian is that it offers support for *callback URLs*. For example, you could include a link to a specific note inside of a task in *Things* or a link to an email message from your Daily Notes in Obsidian.\n\nIn this article, I'll show you a couple of ways you can connect things in Obsidian to other apps. \n\n## Linking to a Note in Obsidian\n\nEach note in Obsidian has its own callback URL that you can use to access that note directly. To get to Obsidian URL, just right-click the note you want and select *Copy obsidian url*:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/copyobsidianurl.jpg)\n\nThe URL is copied to your clipboard, and you can now paste that link in another application like Things. This allows you to manage the task (and all the associated metadata, like due date, project, etc.) in your task manager, and when it's time to write you just click the Obsidian URL in the task to go straight to the note in Obsidian.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thingsobsidianlink.jpg)\n\nHere are the different components that make up this specific URL:\n\n- `obsidian://open?` tells the operating system to access the Obsidian application and open a specific file.\n- `vault=Notes` tells the Obsidian app which vault to look inside.\n- `\u0026file=Articles%2FObsidian%20vs.%20Roam%20Research` specifies the file path in the vault. *Articles* is the folder, and *Obsidian vs. Roam Research* is the file name. *%2F* represents the slash in the directory path, and *%20* represents the spaces in the file name.\n\nThis URL works on both macOS and iOS, provided that you have the Obsidian application installed and the vault names are the same. (Of course, the file must exist on your other device as well.)\n\n## Linking to a Task from Your Daily Notes Page\n\nAnother thing you can do is take tasks from your task manager and put those URLs inside of Obsidian. For example, you can use Obsidian like a digital [Bullet Journal](https://thesweetsetup.com/mikes-hybrid-bullet-journal-system/) and link to the task you want to complete today in your Daily Notes.\n\n*(In the above post, I was still using Roam Research. I've since switched to Obsidian, but the flow is still the same. If you're wondering which app is right for you, check out [[Obsidian vs. Roam Research]] for a comprehensive comparison.)*\n\nFirst, you need to make sure that you have the Daily Notes core plugin enabled. To do this, click the *Settings* icon in the lower-left and go to *Core Plugins* section, then toggle on *Daily Notes*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dailynoteson.jpg)\n\nNow you can create a new Daily Note by clicking the calendar icon in the left sidebar. \n\nNext, get the URL of the task you want to add to your Daily Notes page. In Things, you can do this by right-clicking on the task and selecting *Share \u0026rarr; Copy Link*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thingssharelink.jpg)\n\nNow we can go back to our Daily Notes page and add this link. If we use the formatting `- [ ]` then Obsidian recognizes this text as a task and creates a clickable checkbox for the item. Here's what it looks like in split view, with Edit Mode on the left and Preview Mode on the right:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dailynotesurl.jpg)\n\nThere's a box with an arrow to the right of the link, telling us it's an external link and will take us out of Obsidian. But when we click on this link, we go straight to the task in Things.\n\n## Grabbing URLs with Hook\n\nOn the Mac, there's another cool way to grab links to just about anything using an app called [Hook](https://hookproductivity.com/). For example, you can use Hook to grab a URL to a specific message in your email client. Here's how it works:\n\nUsing your Mac, open the window of the thing you want to link to and activate Hook. You can set a keyboard shortcut for this (mine is set to *Shift-Control-Option-Command-L*), and the Hook window will appear on top of the application window:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hooklink.jpg)\n\nThe second button from the left is the one to copy the link, so click that and the link to the message is copied to your clipboard. Now you can paste that URL in Obsidian, just like we did with the link to the task on our Daily Notes page:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hooklinkobsidian.jpg)\n\nThis is actually just the tip of the iceberg with Hook, though. Just like Obsidian creates bidirectional links between your notes, you can actually create bidirectional links between your files with Hook.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Capturing-to-iCloud-Drive-Obsidian-from-Drafts":{"title":"Capturing to iCloud Drive \u0026 Obsidian from Drafts","content":"\n\nObsidian is great at a lot of things, but quick capturing text is not one of them. I prefer to quick capture my text in Drafts and then send it to Obsidian using Drafts Actions. Unfortunately, if your vault is stored in iCloud Drive, this hasn't always been possible. But thanks to the Bookmarks  feature added in Drafts version 28, you can now store text outside of the Drafts iOS sandbox. \n\n*(BTW, if you want more info on Obsidian for iOS, check out [[Using Obsidian on iOS]].)*\n\n## Setting Up the Bookmark\n\nFirst, tap on the gear icon in the lower right of the Drafts screen to go to the Settings. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts1.jpg)\n\nNext, scroll down to the *Storage* section and tap *Bookmarks*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts2.jpg)\n\nTap the plus icon in the upper right to add a bookmark. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts3.jpg)\n\nGive your bookmark a name.

The first line of the text in the Draft is the title, and everything else is the body. We can use those tokens when we set up our File Action here in just a second. \n\nTap the Drafts icon in the upper right to go to access the Drafts Actions. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts7.jpg)\n\nNext, tap the plus button at the bottom and select *New Action*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts8.jpg)\n\nName this action (once again, I'll call this *Inbox*),  choose a new icon and color if you'd like, and then select *Steps*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts9.jpg)\n\nTap the plus button to add a step and scroll down to select *File*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts10.jpg)\n\nThere's a couple things we need to change in this action. By default, this is going to insert a timestamp for the file name and use a `.txt` file extension (which is not going to work with Obsidian). So let's change the extensions to `.md`and change the time token to `title`. This will take the first line of my Draft and insert that text as the title for the file. \n\nNext, let's go to the template and remove the Draft content and put in the `body` content. So this will put all of the text below the first line into the contents of the text file that we're creating. \n\nHere's what it should like so far:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts11.jpg)\n\nYou may have noticed that there's a path field, but we're not going to worry about that because further down we can choose the *Destination*. Choose *Bookmark*, then tap the plus button and select the bookmark that you created in the Drafts settings. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts12.jpg)\n\nOnce you're finished, tap *Save \u0026 Exit* to save the Drafts Action.\n\n## Using the Action\n\nNow we can trigger this action on the selected Draft. Just tap the button in the upper right and then tap the action that you want to use. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts13-1.jpg)\n\nWe'll get a confirmation when the action runs, and can see the file appear in our Files app.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts14.jpg)\n\nAnd since our Obsidian vault is looking at that folder, the text is now viewable inside of our Obsidian app.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drafts15.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, the first line of the draft has been inserted as the title and everything below that has been inserted as the body text in the note.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Changing-Your-Obsidian-Theme":{"title":"A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins","content":"\nThe appearance of  the interface Obsidian is controllable by CSS, but fortunately you don't need to be a web developer in order to customize the look and feel of Obsidian using *Community Themes*. In this post, we'll walk you through how to install and use a new theme in Obsidian. \n\nObsidian ships with a default theme that actually looks pretty good, especially if you already like the look of dark mode on your Mac. But if you want to change the appearance using custom themes, it is very easy to do that. First, click on the Gear icon in the left sidebar to access the Settings:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme1.jpg)\n\nFrom there, click on the *Appearance* tab. This will let you change quite a few things about the look and feel of Obsidian, including the selected theme.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme2.jpg)\n\nRight now we're looking at the base theme, which as I mentioned is a dark theme. But there's also a light version available, so if you don't like this dark theme, you can just select *Light* from the *Base Theme* section. Here's what the light theme would looks like:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme3.jpg)\n\nBut in addition to the built in light and dark themes, there are a bunch of community themes you can use to customize the look and feel of Obsidian.\n\nTo use a community theme, go back to the *Appearance* section of *Settings*, scroll down a little bit, and click *Browse* for community themes in the *Themes* section. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme4.jpg)\n\nThis opens a gallery of community themes that you can filter by name or by theme type (i.e. show only dark themes). Clicking on a screenshot for a theme will give you a closer look, but you can also preview the theme and when you're ready to install click *Use* to apply the theme to your Obsidian app. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme5.jpg)\n\nThat;s all you need to do. The theme gets applied instantly and the Obsidian is reloaded based on the included CSS. For example, here's what the California Coast theme looks like:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme6.jpg)\n\nYou can even install multiple themes and switch between them from the Settings using the dropdown menu under *Settings --\u003e Appearance --\u003e Themes*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theme7.jpg)\n\nJust select an option from one of your installed themes and the theme changes instantly, giving you a quick way to switch themes and and make your Obsidian interface your own.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Connecting-Notes-Bidirectional-Linking":{"title":"Connecting Notes \u0026 Bidirectional Linking","content":"\nOne of the most powerful features of an app like Obsidian is the ability to make connections between the notes that are in your library. In this article, I'll show you the different ways that you can connect notes and how you can use the bidirectional links that are created to navigate your notes effectively.\n\n## Connecting Notes\n\nHere is a note that I use as a workbench where I formulate my own thoughts on the topic of habits based on everything that I have read, learned, and collected.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting1.jpg)\n\nThis note has several components:\n\n-  A picture of the habit cycle made popular by Charles Duhigg\n-  An opinion note about the habit cycle where I identify what I don't like about this particular model\n-  A link of the Four Laws of Behavior Change by James Clear (which I like better)\n-  A link to BJ the Fogg Behavioral Model\n-  Additional resources on habits\n-  Bible verses that talk about habits\n\nEach one of these contains an internal link to another note inside of my Obsidian vault. This is denoted by the two brackets on the left and right side of the note name in Edit Mode, for example, the *Four Laws of Behavior Change*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting2.jpg)\n\nAnd each one of those links is also displayed as a node in the Local Graph over in the right sidebar. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting3.jpg)\n\nEach one of those notes is called a *linked mention*, and will also show up in the *Linked Mentions* section in the right sidebar.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting4.jpg)\n\nWhen you open a note, the *linked mentions* will show **all** of the places in your entire vault that link to the currently selected note. So for my *MOC - Habits*, there are two linked mentions here. You can use these linked mentions to navigate between different notes by clicking on the dots in the local graph. This opens the new note and updates the local graph and the linked mentions section instantly. So when I go from my *MOC - Habits* note to the one on James clear (which is actually empty right now), the right sidebar still shows me all the places that *James Clear* is linked to.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting5.jpg)\n\nIn this example, my James Clear note is connected to the following notes:\n\n- Atomic Habits\n- MOC - Habits\n- Bookworm 63\n\nThese three notes are also listed in the *Linked Mentions* section, but there is also a section here called *Unlinked Mentions* that shows every other place in my Obsidian library where James clear is mentioned. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting6.jpg)\n\nThis section is basically saying, \"Hey, did you mean to link to this note when you used that term?\" And you can turn any of these unlinked mentioned into a linked mention by hovering over the note and clicking the *Link* button that appears.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting6.jpg)\n\nThis adds double brackets around the term, creating another dot in the local graph and a link between that note where the term appears and the currently selected note. It also creates a two-way street for navigating the notes in our library. For example, I could go from my current note to my *Atomic Habits* note, to my *British Cycling Team* note. But these links are *bidirectional links*, meaning they go both ways. So I can go the other way - from *British Cycling Team* to *Atomic Habits* to *James Clear* to *MOC - Habits*. \n\n## Transcluding Notes\n\nYou can also link notes by transcluding them, which means that you embed them inside of another note. I do this a lot with my sermon sketchnotes where I embed Bible verses by transcluding them. So let's go up here to my file explorer. For example, here's a side-by-side view showing Edit Mode and Preview Mode of my sermon sketchnotes from May 30, 2021. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting7.jpg)\n\nAt the top of the note is the sketchnote I created live, and the underneath that I have headers for the actual verses that were mentioned. The key here is that *each one of these verses is a separate note in Obsidian.* Each verse will show up in my local graph to the right, but you'll notice the difference here is that there's an exclamation point before each link. This tells Obsidian take the contents of that note and display it in the note instead of just linking to it, which allows me to look at these notes and reread the verses that I have mentioned. \n\nThis is great for review purposes, but the big benefit is that I can now build my own cross reference library. Using bidirectional links, I can go from this note to the note for *Philippians 4.6* and see all of other places in my library where I've mentioned *Philippians 4.6* \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/connecting8.jpg)\n\nFrom here, I can even open all these other notes  in separate windows or  tabs and create a workspace inside of Obsidian where I can study this out. \n\nThese are just a couple examples of how you can use connections inside of Obsidian. But one last tip: don't go nuts creating backlinks every place that you can. Be intentional about the connections that you make. Ask yourself, \"when do I want to stumble upon this note again?\" You want more signal and less noise. And if you're intentional about the connections that you create between your notes, you'll be able to leverage a ton of value from those connections in the future.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Daily-Questions-in-Obsidian":{"title":"Daily Questions in Obsidian","content":"\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions.jpg)\n\nI'm a big fan of the mindfulness I gain from journaling, but have been searching for years for the perfect set of prompts that could completely eliminate the friction from my daily journaling workflow. I've tried many different prompts (and many different apps) over the years, but have settled on a practice called *Daily Questions* which has just clicked for me. \n\nIn this post, I'm going to share how I implement my *Daily Questions* inside of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). \n\n## What are Daily Questions?\n\nI first came across the idea of daily questions when I read the book *Triggers* by Marshall Goldsmith for [episode 96 of the Bookworm podcast](https://bookworm.fm/96/) I co-host with my friend [Joe Buhlig](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-joe-buhligs-shabbat-helps-him-stay-intentional/). The basic idea is to answer a series of questions every day based on the criteria, \"did I do my best to (fill in the blank)?\" You simply give yourself a score on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being low and 10 being high.\n\nThe reason this has stuck for me so much better than any journaling prompts ever did is that the Daily Questions are based on your *intention.* Most journaling prompts I've seen are focused on the *outcome*, for example:\n\n- What did I read?\n- What did I learn?\n- What did I do for exercise?\n\nIf these work for you, more power to you. But what I found from answering these types of prompts for years was that I subconsciously resisted journaling when I didn't have something impressive to put there. On good days it was easy to fill these out, but on bad days I knew I had nothing to put there so I resisted going into my journaling app.\n\nI didn't even realize how much friction was there until I started doing the Daily Questions consistently. Once I did, I saw how much easier journaling was for me and realized that I had been \"doing it wrong.\"\n\nThe other thing that made Daily Questions work for me was that [it was a great fit for Roam Research](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-i-use-roam-research-for-journaling/). The sliders were the perfect UI for logging my daily questions, but there was still room for improvement: Roam didn't have a mobile version, and it was still a little cumbersome to pull out trend data without having to go through all the entries manually. \n\nSo when I decided to give [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a try, this was one problem that was front of mind for me to try to solve. And it took a little while, but I believe I've finally got it.\n\n## My Daily Questions Workflow\n\nI'll break this down in detail later, but here's what I do every single day now:\n\n1. I create a new Daily Note in Obsidian that I use for journaling\n2. That note pulls in a template that has my Daily Questions prepopulated (along with a few other things)\n3. I answer my Daily Questions (usually on my Mac, but sometimes on iOS)\n4. I use a plugin to chart my responses over time so I can more easily see trends when doing my quarterly review\n\nHere's what my daily note looks like:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions1.jpg)\n\nAnd here's what the charts look like, broken down by individual question:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions2.jpg)\n\nThere are lots of ways you can customize this, but here's what I personally do to get this data.\n\n## Setting Up the Daily Questions Template\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create your template with your daily questions. Here's how I format mine:\n\n- I use a second-level header for the *Daily Questions* title\n- I use a regular line of text for the question, \"Did I do my best to...\"\n- I nest each question underneath in a bullet list, followed by a nested tag and a rating\n\nHere's what it looks like side-by-side in both *Edit Mode* and *Preview Mode*:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions3.jpg)\n\n(Note that the Journal Entries and Gratitude sections are not necessary.)\n\nI keep this template inside of a *Templates* folder, but you can store it wherever you like.\n\nNow that we've got the template ready, let's take a look at the plugins and settings we need.\n\n## Setting Up Daily Questions in Obsidian\n\nFirst, there are a couple of Core Plugins that you need to enable. Core Plugins are extra functionality that is built into Obsidian but turned off by default. The two core plugins we need to enable are *Daily Notes* and *Templates*. You can access these by clicking on the gear icon in Obsidian and selecting *Core Plugins*, and then make sure that *Daily Notes* and *Templates* are both toggled on.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions4.jpg)\n\nOnce they are enabled, you can configure the settings for each plugin at the bottom of the Settings sidebar. Just click on the name of the plugin, and you'll see the settings for that plugin.\n\nHere are the settings you want to use for the *Daily Notes* plugin:\n\n- The *Date Format* can stay the same.\n- The *New File Location* should be set to the folder where you want to keep your Daily Notes (I keep mine inside of a *Daily Notes* folder).\n- The *Template File Location* should point to the template we set up earlier. This will tell Obsidian what text to prepopulate a new Daily Note with.\n- *Open Daily Note on Startup* doesn't need to be toggled on (unless you want it to be).\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions5.jpg)\n\nNow click on the *Templates* plugin and set up those settings:\n\n- The *Templates folder location* should point to the folder where your templates reside (I recommend you keep these in a separate *Templates* folder, but you don't have to. There's more information on templates, see [[Using Templates in Obsidian]].)\n- The *Date format* and *Time format* settings are fine the way they are.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestion6.jpg)\n\nNow we can start using our template to fill out our Daily Questions. Just click the *Open today's daily note* button on the left sidebar of the Obsidian interface, and a new Daily Note will open with the template we set up. From here, we can fill out our Daily Questions:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions7.jpg)\n\nNow we've got what we need to start collecting the data for our journaling habit, but there's still one more piece to set up that can make reviewing this data a whole lot easier.\n\n## Introducing Tracker\n\nOne of the beautiful things about Obsidian is the ability to use *Community Plugins*. These are plugins developed by third parties that can significantly extend Obsidian's capabilities.\n\nThe one that we want to use for making it easy to review our Daily Questions data is called *Tracker*.\n\n*(For more recommended plugins, check out [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]].)*\n\nTo install Tracker, go the Obsidian Settings and then click on *Community Plugins*. If you've never installed a Community Plugin before, you'll need to toggle off *Safe Mode* and click the *Browse* button to see the available Community Plugins:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions8.jpg)\n\nSearch for and install the *Tracker* plugin, then toggle it on just like you did for the Core Plugins:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions9.jpg)\n\nNext, click *Tracker* in the settings sidebar to configure the Tracker settings:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions10.jpg)\n\nYou can leave the *Default date format*, but make sure that *Default folder location* is pointing to the same folder where you have your Daily Notes stored.\n\nThe *Tracker* plugin is now setup and can be embedded in any note. I use a separate note called *Daily Questions* which shows me graphs of each individual question. \n\nTo use Tracker, you have to use a code snippet. Here's an example:\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ccode\u003e```tracker\nsearchType: tag\nsearchTarget: dailyquestions/spiritual\nline:\n\tyAxisLabel: Rating\n\tyMin: 1\n\tyMax: 9\n```\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\nHere's what's going in this code snippet:\n\n- The first line with the three backticks and tracker is activating the plugin.\n- The *searchType* is telling Tracker to look at the tags in the notes in the designated folder.\n- The *searchTarget* is telling Tracker what text to look for (our nested tag, i.e. dailyquestions/spiritual).\n- The *line* section has a couple of options for changing how the line chart renders.\n- *yAxisLabel* changes the label on the side of the chart.\n- *yMin* and *yMax* control the scale of the chart (this is a little wonky yet, ideally yMin would be 0 and yMax would be 10).\n- The closing three backticks indicate the end of the chart information.\n\n(There are a bunch of other settings you can configure for Tracker via the syntax that you use here, beginning and end dates for setting date ranges. See the full plugin documentation for details.)\n\nI use a second-level header for each category and use this exact same snippet under each one, simply changing the tag to reflect the appropriate question. What this does is pull all the values assigned to those tags and plots them on a graph with the values on the y-axis and the date on the x-axis.\n\nHere's the Edit Mode and Preview Mode side-by-side:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailyquestions11.jpg)\n\nThis makes it incredibly easy to review my data and notice any trends when I do my quarterly reviews.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/General-PKM":{"title":"General PKM","content":"\nI want to...\n\n- Understand Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) better: [[Intro to Personal Knowledge Management]]\n- Understand the differences between Obsidian and Roam Research: [[Obsidian vs. Roam Research]]\n- Make better use of my notes: [[Note-Taking vs. Note-Making]]\n- Figure out how to connect and transclude notes [[Connecting Notes \u0026 Bidirectional Linking]]\n- Read about how Nick Milo applies intentionality to his technology: [[Nick Milo's Mindfulness Monday Interview]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.174383961Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Intro-to-Personal-Knowledge-Management":{"title":"Intro to Personal Knowledge Management","content":"\nPersonal Knowledge Management systems (or PKMs) are all the rage lately. Collecting and connecting information from bookmarks and blog posts in a sort of \"personal wiki\" using tools like Roam Research and Obsidian can help you see your ideas from different perspectives. This can have big benefits not just for lifelong learners, but for anyone who is looking to do their best creative work.\n\nBut before you can really make the most of personal knowledge management apps and services, you need to understand a little bit about how they work.\n\n## What is a Personal Knowledge Management system (PKM)?\n\nWhat exactly do we mean by the term *personal knowledge management?* According to Wikipedia:\n\n\u003e Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in which these processes support work activities (Wright 2005). \n\nEssentially, personal knowledge management is a combination of two other concepts: Personal Information Management (PIM) and Knowledge Management (KM).\n\nLet's consider both of these briefly.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pkmconnections.jpg)\n\nYou're probably already familiar with personal information management (PIM). This is basically the way that you get and keep information in order to help you get things done. For example, maybe you need information sent to you via email in order to complete a task for work. If you send the email to your task manager so that you have the URL to that message when you need it, that's personal information management.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thingspkmconnection.jpg)\n\nThe other concept you need to understand is *knowledge management.* This typically refers to creating or sharing knowledge and information inside of an organization. If you create standard operating procedures so that someone else can complete an organizational task, that is a form of knowledge management. It's ensuring the free flow of information, making sure that the required knowledge doesn't stay siloed and that others can access it when they need it.\n\nPersonal knowledge management combines both of these, but places an additional emphasis on sharing and creating. It's a structure for information and ideas that allows them to be connected across different domains. This results in interesting connections being made, producing new ideas and giving a big boost to the creative process - whether that is expressed through writing, music, or any other medium.\n\nIf you're not sure why you might want to connect your ideas, check out [[Connecting Notes \u0026 Bidirectional Linking]].\n\n## 3 levels of Knowledge\n\nWhat sort of knowledge are managing with a PKM anyway? Let's start by looking at the dictionary definition for knowledge:\n\n\u003e facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education\n\nThis is pretty broad, and could mean a lot of different things. For example, I might have a vague recollection of a statistic I read about in a book but need to do a Google search before I can I can recall what it really means. Or I might have a favorite quote that really speaks to me and I've built my personal values around it.\n\nIn my experience, there are a couple different levels of knowledge:\n\n- **Level 1: Having something (Information)** - a lot of our digital information falls into this category. You have the ability to go find what you're looking for when you need it, but you have to first think about it before you can locate it. If you have a video course that you bought but haven't gone through yet, that would fall into this category.\n- **Level 2: Understanding something (Revelation)** - this is being able to recall something without having to look it up. At this leve, you've internalized the information and are starting to make connections, but it hasn't necessarily changed how you act.\n- **Level 3: Doing something (Application)** - this is where you start to see the result of the information you've collected. You don't just have it or understand it, it's changing your day-to-day actions. This is the first level where there is an actual, visible output from the information that you've collected.\n\nWhy does this matter? \n\n*Because there is too much information.*\n\nFOMO (the fear of missing out) is the desire to have information from somewhere you don't currently. But as soon as you get it, you probably feel FOMO for something else - i.e. Twitter, Facebook, email, Slack, YouTube, etc. By quickly jumping from one input to the next, you feed your desire to know what's happening, but you're unable to contribute to the conversation. You need to do something with the information and ideas that you collect. Like a plant, you need to develop and nurture those ideas to see what they can really turn into.\n\nAnd one of the ways to incubate those ideas is connect them to others and see what happens.\n\n## How does a PKM help?\n\nA good personal knowledge management system reveals connections between pieces of information. When you give your brain time and space to think, it is already *really* good at this. The problem is that it is easily overwhelmed by whatever urgent thing happens to be in front of it and it's terrible at remembering things from a long time ago.\n\nA PKM helps overcome these genetic weaknesses by serving as an external brain. It allows you to see the connections that are already there and make new ones, which is extremely valuable when you allow yourself to incubate these ideas for a long period of time.\n\nWhile the term PKM has gained immense popularity recently, it's actually nothing new. There have personal knowledge management systems in place for many years. Here's some examples:\n\n- A Commonplace Book - basically a collection of notes, quotes, and anecdotes that you want to remember. Author Ryan Holiday has a great explanation of the commonplace book [here](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/).\n- [Mind Maps](https://thesweetsetup.com/why-mind-mapping-works/)\n- [Sketchnotes](https://thesweetsetup.com/guide-sketchnoting-ipad-goodnotes/)\n\nSome of the most prolific creators in human history have been using versions of the personal knowledge management system for hundreds of years.\n\nTechnology just allows to connect things in powerful ways that were unavailable to the creatives that came before us.\n\n## Why You Should Give Some Thought to Your PKM\n\n*Because you ARE creative.*\n\nYou just might have forgotten how.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a writer, musician, desk jockey or engineer - you have the ability to be creative.\n\nCreativity, like everything else in life, is a system. There's an input, a process, and an output. So if you haven't been seeing much creative output, it doesn't mean you lack something in your DNA - it means you need to change your inputs or process.\n\nI know this because I've struggled with this myself.\n\nI used to believe the lie that I just wasn‚Äôt creative. I remember playing guitar and writing songs, then getting mad when I realized that I had unintentionally picked up a melody or chord progression from another song I heard on the radio. I used to think to myself, ‚Äúwhat is wrong with me? Why can‚Äôt I create anything original?‚Äù\n\nBut when I read Steal Like an Artist, I understood that *nothing* completely original. When someone creates something, they are simply connecting dots in new ways. That's when I realized that if I wanted to get better at creating, I just needed to collect better dots. \n\n\u003e ‚ÄúYour job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.‚Äù - Austin Kleon\n\nAnd all of a sudden, I was free. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have to judge my creation as inferior because it was simply the results of the dots I had collected. And when I started changing my inputs (listening to podcasts, reading books), I found it easier to synthesize those ideas and create something new.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is why you should use a PKM - it helps you connect ideas and makes it easier for you to do your best creative work.\n\n## What Makes a Good PKM?\n\nA PKM is not a single application. Rather, it's a series of apps that connect together to make it easier to disseminate ideas across multiple domains. The goal is not to have information siloed, but be able to share and link it easily.\n\nHere are some of the key components of a good PKM:\n\n- **Note Taking** - you need a place where you can take notes \n- **Quick Capture** - capturing an idea when you have it is important so that it doesn't get lost.\n- **Visual Thinking** - this is simply a way of looking at the relationship between your ideas. One common example of this would be a mind map on a topic or a graph view in an app like Roam or Obsidian.\n- **Read-It-Later** - RSS can be a source of ideas, but not if it just stays inside your RSS app. Don't overlook Read-It-Later services, and make sure you have a way to capture things you want to keep.\n- **Project Management** - whether you are a \"knowledge worker\" or a corporate desk jockey, you need a way to turn ideas into tasks.\n- **Archive** - this is simple a place to hold things when you're done with them. You probably won't need to go back into the archive very often, but it's important to be able to find something later if you need it.\n- **Output** - remember, your personal knowledge management system is supposed to make it *easy* for you to create. If there isn't any output, something is broken. After you've connected your dots, you need a way to express them.\n\nYou may take quick capture notes in Drafts, manage projects in Things, make mind maps in MindNode, and do all your writing (output) in Ulysses. That is a very valid approach to personal knowledge management. \n\nBut how do you turn your captured ideas turn into projects? Or how does your mind map in help your writing? \n\n## The Problem with the Filing Cabinet (The Trend Towards Zettlekasten)\n\nWhen it comes to managing information, most people are familiar with the traditional *filing cabinet approach*. With the filing cabinet approach, when you have a thought to find something you know exactly where to look for it. Your folder hierarchy or tagging system may not mak sense to anyone else, but that's ok - you can recall information in a flash with a simple search command.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/filingcabinet.jpg)\n\nThe problem with this approach is that you have to have the thought first before you can find the file. In other words, it is a **Think --\u003e Find** approach. Search tools allow you to find something when you need it later, but ultimately it's not doing any good tucked away in that folder *until you think of it*.\n\nThe best PKMs borrow heavily from the Zettlekasten method made popular by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. He was a prolific creator - in only 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of papers. He credits the secret to his output to an external system to think in which he termed a *zettlekasten* (German for \"slip box\").\n\nHis zettlekasten was exactly what it sounds like - a slip box for idea, which he kept stocked with index cards. When he read something he wanted to retain, he would write the citation on one side and make brief notes on the other side. Looking at his brief notes, he would write his ideas, comments, and thoughts on a new card in the personal section. And whenever adding a note, he‚Äôd look for connections to other notes and keep them grouped together. This allowed him to view all of his related notes and ideas at once, which inspired the creative process.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zettelkasten.jpg)\n\nWith a zettlekasten, the value is not a single great idea - it's the volume of ideas you collect and the way they bump into each other. It's basically idea soup, where you mix everything together and see what comes out.  The network is more powerful than any individual node.\n\nFortunately, we've come a long way since the original zettlekasten. Instead of carrying around hundreds of notecards, our computers let us connect these ideas quickly and easily and access them anywhere, anytime.\n\nThe most powerful version of this is *the backlink*. This allows you to retroactively apply links between ideas in your personal knowledge management system after they've been added. For example, you may have a master note on \"Habits\" that can show you all the other instances of the term *habits* in your entire PKM, and clicking on any of the links will instantly take you to those old notes and ideas.\n\nThis is different than a wiki-style link because you don't need to manually make the connection when adding the new note (Mr. Luhmann would be extremely jealous).\n\n## Recommended Resources for Building Your PKM\n\nWhen it comes to making these connection, there are many different approaches and the app you decide to use will have very opinionated preferences about how to do this. Here are a few of our favorites.\n\n### Roam Research\n\nRoam Research is web note taking app built for connected thought. Roam allows you to write ideas and notes in plain text using Markdown, then connect those notes and ideas together using page and block references. It's a powerful system that allows you to connect not just individual files together, but even specific sections of a document.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roamresearch.jpg)\n\nLinking things together in Roam is both easy and powerful. There are lots of incredible ways you can use these backlinks:\n\n- [For Journaling](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-i-use-roam-research-for-journaling/)\n- [For timeblocking](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-roam-research-helps-me-time-block-my-day/)\n- [For GTD-style task management](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-roam-research-for-gtd-style-task-management/)\n- [For Contact Relationship Management](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-roam-research-as-a-customer-relationship-manager/)\n- [For personal Bible study](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-im-using-roam-research-for-bible-study/)\n\nYou can do just about anything in Roam Research if you take the time to set it up correctly. It gives you a ton of productivity building blocks that you can use to craft your own system. It's also easy to extend the functionality of the app using custom scripts or CSS.\n\nThe big drawback to Roam for some people is that everything is cloud-based (no individual local files). You can export your Roam graph into JSON or Markdown files, but everything lives on the Roam servers. There's also no native application, for iOS or otherwise. It is purely a web app - for good or bad. It also uses a variation of Markdown that is fairly annoying, and is very expensive ($15/month or $165/year).\n\n### Obsidian\n\nThe big competitor to Roam Research is Obsidian. Like Roam, Obsidian seeks to help you connect your thoughts and ideas using plain text and backlinks. The big difference is that while Roam is a web app, Obsidian works on top of your local text files. That's right, you don't have to upload *anything*. This makes it a great option for people who need more security for their notes than Roam is able to offer.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/obsidian.jpg)\n\nObsidian is an electron app that runs locally on your computer, but it is blazing fast and handles local links much better than Roam does. The speed of updates of Obsidian is also pretty amazing, with new versions being released roughly every week. This pace of updates has quickly closed the gap with Roam, and the third-party plugin framework makes it easy to extend Obsidian in a bunch of really useful ways.\n\nObsidian is also completely free. If you want to sync your data between devices using end-to-end encryption, you can purchase that as an add-on for $4/month. There's also an add-on which makes publishing text in Obsidian to a website easier for $8/month. Even with both of these add-ons though, it's still less than Roam Research and a great option for your PKM.\n\n### Craft\n\nCraft is an interesting app that isn't really a direct comparison to either Roam or Obsidian. It's essentially a document manager, but offers beautiful native apps for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/craftconnection.jpg)\n\nThey also recently added backlinks which gives you the structure you need to use it for personal knowledge management, and they recently announced Craft Connect which allows you to send and receive info from a handful of our favorite apps. Here the are apps that are currently supported [according to the Craft website](https://www.craft.do/whats-new):\n\n- Drafts\n- Things\n- OmniFocus\n- iA Writer\n- Ulysses\n- Bear\n- Day One\n- NotePlan\n\nWhile it's still fairly new, Craft shows a lot of promise. You can check out Josh's impression of Craft [here](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-craft-notes-for-study-and-preserving-long-term-knowledge/).\n\n### Hook\n\nHook is more of a utility than an application, but it can still very handy when building your own personal knowledge management system. It lets you to quickly grab a link to whatever you happen to be looking at on your computer that you can then use to get back there whenever you need to. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hook.jpg)\n\nThe beauty of Hook is that it allows you to connect just about anything to just about anything. Doesn't matter if it's a task in your task manager, an email in your inbox, or a local PDF on your Mac - just pop up Hook and you can easily grab a link to whatever you need. You can also use Markdown formatting for these links, which makes it perfect for pasting into plain text in an app like Roam or Obsidian.\n\n## Some Tips for Building Your Personal Knowledge Management System\n\nRegardless of the apps you decide to use, here are a few things to keep in mind as you are building out your PKM.\n\n### Curate Your Collection\n\nOne of the mistakes that is easy to make at the beginning is to connect *everything*. But not every idea you have or new piece of information you come across is worth a note in your PKM. To really make the most of your network of ideas, you need to curate them by keeping the relevant information and discarding the stuff that won't be useful.  Figuring out the difference can take some time, but it's worthwhile to figure this out. \n\n### Supplement Your Workflow\n\nDon't change everything simply because you want to try a shiny new app. If you've used Evernote as a collection point for years and have hundreds of notebooks full of information, moving everything to another app is a significant time investment. Look to streamlining your information workflow so that the apps you already use can communicate together better.\n\n### Consider Your Sources\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, there's too much information to try and keep up with it all. So figure out which sources are worth paying precious attention to.  By limiting the number of blogs you follow or websites you read on a regular basis, you can make more of the new information you do receive. By decreasing the quantity, the quality naturally increases.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Journaling":{"title":"Journaling","content":"\nI want to...\n\n- Set up Daily Questions: [[Daily Questions in Obsidian]]\n- Add entries from anywhere in Obsidian: [[Journaling in Obsidian with QuickAdd]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Journaling-in-Obsidian-with-QuickAdd":{"title":"","content":"\nObsidian is a great place to do your digital journaling, thanks to the daily notes core plugin. But with the addition of the quick add community plugin, you can quickly capture journal entries into specific categories using the command palette. \n\n*(If you're looking for the Daily Questions part of my journaling workflow, check out [[Daily Questions in Obsidian]].)*\n\n## Setting Up the Daily Notes\n\nFirst, we need to make sure that *Daily Notes* core plugin is in fact toggled on. To access the Settings, click on the gear icon in the lower left.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd1.jpg)\n\nNext, click on *Core Plugins* and make sure that *Daily Notes* plugin is toggled on. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd2.jpg)\n\nNext, go to the sidebar of the settings and scroll down to the *Daily Notes* section. Here you can configure the new file location which tells Obsidian where to store the new Daily Notes files and the location of your template file. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd3.jpg)\n\nI have this set to capture new Daily Notes to a *Daily Notes* folder using my *Journaling template* inside of my *Templates* directory. This will take the contents of that file and insert it into the new Daily Note when I create it. So let's close our settings, and take a look at our journaling template. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd4.jpg)\n\nI have three different sections here:\n\n- one for learnings, \n- one for journal entries, and \n- one for gratitude.  \n\nSo when I click on the new Daily Notes button over here on the left, those three sections will automatically be added to today's Daily Note. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd5.jpg)\n\nOnce we have our Daily Notes configured, we're ready to set up QuickAdd plugin.\n\n## Setting Up the QuickAdd Plugin\n\nGo back to the Settings, select *Community plugins*, and click Browse. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd6.jpg)\n\nNext, search for QuickAdd.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd7.jpg)\n\nClick *Install*, then click *Enable*.\n\nOnce we've installed and enabled the plug in, go over to the left and scroll down to the *QuickAdd* settings. QuickAdd can do a lot of different things, but we're going to be using it to quickly capture text that we want to add to specific sections in our journal. So let's create a section here for *Learnings*. And instead of a template, we're going to select *Capture*, then click *Add choice*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd8.jpg)\n\nNow click on the gear icon for the Learnings action that we just created and configure the settings. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd9.jpg)\n\nFirst we can set what file we want to capture this information to we can choose either the active file or a specific file. Capturing to a specific file allows us to capture to the file from anywhere in Obsidian, so that's what we'll use (`Daily Notes/{{DATE:gggg-MM-DD}}.md`)\n\nThis selects the Daily Notes folder, uses a date token to insert today's date, and adds a `.md` for the file extension. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd10.jpg)\n\nThis will translate to the same date format we use for our Daily Note. \n\nNext,  scroll down and select *Insert after* and add `## Learnings` to insert our added text after the second level header for *Learnings*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd11.jpg)\n\nNext, we need to put in the value for what we want to capture. So toggle on *Capture format* and then use `- {{VALUE}} #journal/learnings \\n`.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd12.jpg)\n\nThis will create a bullet point with the captured text, then automatically add the tag *journal/learnings* and then create a new line. \n\nWe can repeat this process for the other sections, resulting in 3 different QuickAdd entries. And we can enable these directly from the *Command Palette* (without having to launch QuickAdd first) by clicking on the lightning bolt icons. next to the choices we want to enable.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd13.jpg)\n\n## Using QuickAdd\n\nNow from anywhere in Obsidian, we can hit `Command - P` to invoke the Command Palette, search for *QuickAdd*, and to select the one that we want to use (i.e. *Entry*)\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd14.jpg)\n\nThen we just type out our text, hit *Enter*, and the text that we just typed gets pasted into the appropriate section in our Daily Note. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quickadd15.jpg)\n\nQuickAdd also works on the mobile version of Obsidian, which is great way to journal from my iPhone at the end of the day.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Keyboard-Hotkeys-and-The-Command-Pallette":{"title":"","content":"\nObsidian is great for Mac nerds like me who like to do everything from their keyboard. In this article, we'll show you how to access commands via the *Command Palette* and set custom hotkeys for triggering commands using keyboard shortcuts.\n\n## The Command Palette\n\nThere are a lot of commands that are available to you via the *Command Palette*, which is sort of like macOS Spotlight for Obsidian. But you do need to make sure that it's enabled before you can use it. \n\nTo enable the Command Palette, click on the *Settings* button in the left sidebar.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys1.jpg)\n\nNext, go to **Core Plugins** and make sure that the **Command Palette** core plugin is toggled on. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys2.jpg)\n\nOnce it's enabled, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Command-P` to access the Command Palette from any note. From here, you can see all of the commands that are available. So for example, if you want to get the Obsidian URL for a note (great for linking notes to tasks in your task manager), then select **Copy Obsidian URL**. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys3.jpg)\n\nHit *Enter* to execute the command and the URL will be copied to your clipboard. You may also see a notification in the upper-right confirming the action.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys4.jpg)\n\nYou may also notice that some of the commands in the Command Palette have the plugin name before them. For example, the commands added by the [Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) will have `Kanban:` before the command name.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys5.jpg)\n\nTyping a plugin name like this in the Command Palette after installing and enabling it is a great way to discover what it can do. \n\n## Keyboard Hotkeys\n\nYou can also see the hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) associated with a command in the Command Palette. For example, if you toggle on the *Daily Notes* core plugin and look for the command options for daily notes in the Command Palette, you'll see a command to open today's daily note as well as the keyboard shortcut associated with that command (`Command-Control-Option-Up arrow`). \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys6.jpg)\n\nWith this command highlighted, hitting *Enter* does the exact same thing as using that keyboard shortcut. You can also customize those hotkeys by going to **Settings \u0026rarr; Hotkeys**. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys7.jpg)\n\nThis gives you a list of all the commands available in Obsidian, and you can customize any hotkey you want by clicking the box on the right and typing the desired keyboard shortcut. So if you go to your *Daily Notes* section, you can set a keyboard shortcut for opening the next Daily Note and the previous Daily Note. Let's set these to `Command-Control-Option-Right arrow` and `Command-Control-Option-Left arrow` respectively.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys8.jpg)\n\nNow when viewing a Daily Note you can use these keyboard shortcuts to cycle forward and backward by date. \n\n## Bonus: Assigning Mouse Buttons\n\nI've actually taken this even further though, and I've programmed those specific keyboard shortcuts to specific buttons on my mouse (which is a Logitech MX Master 3). With this mouse, I can program specific buttons for specific apps with the Logitech Options software. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys9.jpg)\n\nYou can create global shortcuts or app-specific shortcuts. So if I go to *Obsidian*, I can now program my *Next/Previous Daily Note* shortcuts to specific mouse buttons like so:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hotkeys10.jpg)\n\nAnd now when I'm in Obsidian, I can navigate back and forth in my Daily Notes using only those side buttons on my mouse.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Meeting-Notes-in-Obsidian":{"title":"","content":"\nObsidian is a great place to keep meeting notes. But there are a couple of best practices, which can make your meeting notes more effective. In this article, we walk you through setting up a meeting notes template and how to use it in Obsidian.\n\n## Setting Up the Meeting Notes Template\n\nCreating a template makes it much easier to take meeting notes. This template is simply a note in my Obsidian vault. Here's the meeting notes template I use:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes1.jpg)\n\nThis template has 4 sections:\n\n- A date token at the top\n- An *Attendees* section\n- An *Agenda* section\n- An *Action items* section\n\nEach section is separated as a second-level header, except for the metadata at the top. \n\nThe date token in the curly brackets tells Obsidian to insert a date stamp using the YYYY-MM-DD format, and the double brackets link that date to the daily note for the day.\n\nOnce you have your template file the way you want it, the next step is to set up the Templates plugin.\n\n## Setting Up the Templates Plugin\n\nFirst, click on the *Settings* button in the left sidebar.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes2.jpg)\n\nSelect *Core Plugins*, and make sure *Templates* is toggled on. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes3.jpg)\n\nNext, go to the setting for the Templates plugin and make sure that it is pointing at the folder where you have your Meeting Notes template stored.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes4.jpg)\n\nOnce you have the plugin enabled and pointing at your templates directory, we're ready to use the template we created.\n\n## Using the Template\n\nTo use the template, you first need to create a new blank note. Give your note a title, and then hit *Command-P* to access the Command Palette. From the Command Palette. select the *Template: Insert template* option.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes5.jpg)\n\nIf you pointed the Templates plugin at the right folder, you should see all the files in that folder appear as template options.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes6.jpg)\n\nSelect your meeting notes template and hit *Enter.* The empty note populates with the contents of your template file. The date token is converted to today's date, and each of your sections is created.\n\n## Meeting Notes Tips\n\nI like to link the attendees to the meeting notes by including their names in the *Attendees* section in double-brackets. This links the meeting notes file and the person via the Local Graph.\n\nI also use double brackets to create internal links to important agenda items. For example, if we're talking about a project, I'll use double brackets to link to the project name.\n\nYou can also use Obsidian's Markdown-based task syntax to track action items. Just use a `- [ ]` before the task name and it will render as a clickable box in Preview mode.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/meetingnotes7.jpg)\n\nYou can also link those tasks to a specific person or date by adding either inside of double brackets as well.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Mikes-Obsidian-Based-Writing-Workflow":{"title":"","content":"\nI've been using Obsidian as my writing app for the past several months, and I absolutely love it. In addition to giving me a great Markdown writing environment, the community plugins allow me to craft my ideal system for tracking my writing tasks well. In this article, I walk through my system and the plugins I use to manage writing projects in Obsidian.\n\nHere's a video from our upcoming PKM \u0026 Obsidian course that walks through my entire process.\n\nVIDEO\n\nThere are two specific plugins that make this work for me:\n\n1. The Kanban plugin\n2. The Dataview plugin\n\n*(For more info on using the Dataview plugin, see [[YAML \u0026 Dataview]].)*\n\n## The Kanban Plugin\n\nTo install the kanban plugin, first click on the *Settings* button in the left sidebar.\n\nIMG\n\nNext, click on *Community Plugins* and search for *Kanban*.\n\nIMG\n\nClick the *Install* button, then click enable. Make sure that the plugin is toggled on by going back to the *Community Plugins* section in the settings.\n\nIMG\n\nNext, you need to create your kanban board. To create a new Kanban board view, all you  need to do is right-click in a folder and then select *New Kanban board*. \n\nIMG\n\nOnce you have the board set up, you need to add some categories. Click the *Add a list* button to create a new swim lane and give it a name.\n\nI use three separate lists: *ToDo*, *Doing*, and *Done*. I also toggle on the option to *Mark items in this list as complete* for the *Done* column.\n\nIMG\n\nNext I add cards for the articles I'm working on. Click *Add a card* to create a new todo in that column, and give the card a name. I always create the blank note first in my *Articles* folder and link to the note using double brackets.\n\nIMG\n\nThen I can move the card from left to right by dragging it to the appropriate column. And behind it all is a simple Markdown-formatted text file.\n\nIMG\n\n## Dataview\n\nI also add some YAML metadata to the top of every article which includes the status and document tags. I'm playing around with different ways to use the status currently, but one thing I like is the ability to use a status and filter everything in my *Articles* folder by that staus using the *Dataview* plugin.\n\nJust like the Kanban plugin, Dataview is a third-party plugin. So click the *Settings* buttone, go to *Community Plugins*, and serach for *Dataview*.\n\nIMG\n\nInstall and enable the plugin, and you're ready to go.\n\nFor example, I have a note in my library called *Articles Status*. It's a blank note that filters all the notes in my *Articles* and displays them in a list view by status in the YAML metadata.\n\nHere's the code I use:\n\n```dataview\ntable Status\nfrom \"Articles\"\n```\n\nHere's what this code is doing:\n\n- The first line tells Obsidian to use the Dataview plugin \n- The second line tells it to make a table with a *Status* column\n- The third line tells it to look in the *Articles* folder\n- The last line closes the code block\n\nWhen I click on *Preview*, here's what it looks like:\n\nIMG\n\nI have the names of all of the articles that are currently in my articles folder on the left, which are links that I can use to jump straight to those articles. And I have the status fields, indicated by those things that I marked in the YAML frontmatter, which aren't actually part of the article. But Dataview is taking those and it is sorting them in reverse alphabetical order, which allows me to see very quickly which articles I've completed, which ones I've not started and which ones are in progress. And if I wanted, I could add more to this to sort these in a specific order.\n\nThis is a simple example, and you can extend this obviously a lot further if you wanted to include due dates and things like that. But Dataview is a great way to  query everything that you want to look at in a specific location, and then give you all sorts of information based on that.

He also hosts a phenomenal [community-driven workshop](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) where he helps people craft their own custom PKM system.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nickmilo.jpg)\n\nI first discovered Nick when I went through the workshop myself, and it was the first time that Obsidian really clicked for me. His explanation of idea emergence in particular was a big help as I was trying to wrap my head around how I was going to use Obsidian. \n\nOver the last several months as [I've gotten to know Nick](https://www.relay.fm/focused/122), I've continually been impressed with his perspective on idea development. I've learned a lot from him about knowledge management, and am thrilled that he agreed to share about his own mindful approach to technology use.\n\n###### What sort of boundaries or intentional constraints (i.e. rules) have you set up around how you use your technology?  \n\nIn an age where The Screen dominates, it's easier than ever to live in a perpetual state of distraction. That won't surprise this audience. In the age \"Before Screen\" (BS), our default was to walk around, to daydream, and to talk with people. Now, After Screen (AS), the default is to fall from one distraction to the next. So we have to define our own intentional constraints if we want to get the best out of The Screen, without falling into it.  \n\nMy constraints take the form of whispers in the back of my mind that say things like:   \n\n- Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  \n- How are you being manipulated right now?  \n- What is your environment doing to you right now?  \n  \nThat does two things: it makes me aware, and gets me peeved. I think getting peeved is a good thing in this context because it gives me enough of a kick in the butt to break The Screen's powerful hold over me.  \n  \n###### What does your phone home screen look like? How has the application of your intentional constraints shaped what shows up here?  \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nickmiloiphone.jpg)\n\nNothing special here. I try not to use my phone much. Honestly, it kinda *feels* wrong...hunching over, working inefficiently when I have a keyboard and mouse nearby. I mainly browse with Firefox, check email with Gmail, sometimes check the chats, watch Youtube vids at night, and now also jump into the Obsidian app at night. So my main constraint is just not using it.  \n  \n###### As you apply intentionality to your use of technology, what are some examples of what you consider to be net positive technology uses?  \n\nWithout a doubt, note-making in Obsidian is my favorite net positive technology use.   \n  \nPlainly speaking, that means I type out things that mean something to me in a bunch of different notes and make links between those notes, which leads me to re-write (refactor) those same notes into something that some people might call some form of wisdom.   \n  \nI think this is the most valuable use of technology for about a million reasons, but I'll only pick three for now: note-making helps you create \"value\" in the world, it forces you to do critical and creative thinking, and it coaxes you into a state of Flow.   \n  \n###### What was your tipping point ‚Äî the moment when you decided you needed to do something about your technology defaults?  \n\nGrowing up in Montana, it was easy to *not* get lost in technology because it was too easy to get lost in Nature. So moving to NYC was a radical break from that. The streets were littered with people walking with their heads down buried in their phones. It felt like some alternative reality.   \n  \nI tried it. It tried to look at my phone while walking, but I would immediately notice my levels of anxiety start to creep upward. When I put my phone back in my pocket, my intuitive anxiety meter would go back down to natural levels.  \n  \nWhy was everybody else seemingly not concerned about this?!  \n  \nThe tipping point was at the HBO offices where I used to work, specifically in the fitness center where this guy spent an hour every day on the elliptical treadmill with his back hunched and neck cranked to the extreme just so he could stare at his phone. That guy thought he was getting healthier but I just saw his body getting sicker and more contorted over time.  \n  \nYears later and it still angers me, even though I don't really know what I'm even mad at! I just know that I have taken a personal vow to never become like that guy on the treadmill.  \n  \n###### As you‚Äôve changed your technology habits, what are some of the things you‚Äôve had to learn to work around or live without?  \n\nI've had to allow myself the freedom to stop trying to track and manage every tiny task and project. My efforts always led to an entire breakdown in the system, where I would abandon the system and feel bad about it. But what if I wasn't the problem?   \n  \nWhat if the problem was believing some rigid digital system‚Äîthat required high-maintenance ‚Äîwas ever going to be a good solution in the first place? It wasn't. It was always bound to fail (at least for me).   \n  \nPlus, it cut me off from using my intuition and instincts to rapidly adjust to new information. Rigid systems to manage yourself fall apart under new stressors. So now I don't have an actual project management system; I don't use any special software to manage projects, and I'm getting a tremendous amount of stuff done. It's counter-intuitive maybe, but it's very liberating.  \n  \n###### What app (or service) has the strongest pull towards getting you to go back to the way things were? And how do you deal with it?  \n\nDiscord or Twitter and even YouTube at times. I don't know how I deal with it really. I guess there comes a point where it starts to feel bad. Then, if my energy levels are normal, I'll just stop doing it. If my energy levels are so low and my distractability is high, then I'll re-prompt myself with those questions from the top: \"how are you being manipulated right now?\" Then I get peeved enough to get up and change my environment ASAP.  \n  \n###### How has implementing boundaries or intentional constraints positively impacted your life?  \n\nOne of the best things I ever did with my relationship to knowledge was defining it.   \n  \nThere is an exponentially growing amount of information available to each of us. That used to fill me with dread because I thought I would always feel inadequate in my knowledge. But then the opposite happened. Instead of worrying about the Noise, I focused on my Signal: the things that really resonated with me.   \n  \nDefining what the Signal was for me made it okay to stop worrying about the Noise.  \n  \n###### How has your approach to Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) influenced your intentional technology use?  \n\nIt's taken me out of the rat race. I'm no longer addicted to shiny new apps \"just because\". I'm now constantly a version behind every new Mac OS release. I don't care that Apple gave one of their apps some silly shiny feature that I'll use once and then never use again. I don't care about the shiny stuff because I care so deeply about my signal. And when you have a clear signal, all that noise is no longer enticing ‚Äîit's annoying.  \n  \nAnd then‚Äîand this is getting philosophical‚Äîonce you get out of the Noise and hone in on your Signal...you recognize \"Knowledge\" isn't static and it's not meant to just be consumed. Instead, you can interact with it, develop your opinions about it, and make personally meaningful insights around it. What a soul-nourishing endeavor that is!  \n  \n###### What are the apps/devices that use to manage the different areas of your PKM system?  \n\nMy main apps: Obsidian, Firefox, Gmail, Fantastical, Drafts, and Dropbox.  \n  \n###### Do you have any guidelines/rules for what comes on or goes out of your PKM system?  \n\nYes. I practice what I call \"Radical Idea Emergence.\" Basically, if I forget something, that means it wasn't important enough to remember. But if I keep re-remembering something, then I recognize its importance and I externalize it in my PKM system (digitally write it down) so I can better think and build with it. I could go on, but in short: I don't over-collect because I have faith that the good ideas find a way; they will earn a place at the table.  \n  \n###### What‚Äôs your best advice for the person who is trying to change how they use their technology to be more intentional?  \n\nI have made it an unconscious habit to ask three questions when something doesn't feel right:  \n  \n1. What is your relationship to knowledge right now? (Are you even aware of what it is?)  \n2. How are you being manipulated right now? (Are you okay with that?)  \n3. What is your environment doing to you right now? (How is it shaping you?)   \n  \nIf you ask those questions, you can't help but recognize when something is off, and you'll have the zest and perspective you need to do something about it.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Note-Taking-vs.-Note-Making":{"title":"","content":"\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/notemaking.jpg)\n\nI've been thinking a lot about Personal Knowledge Management lately and the path information takes as it enter and exits my PKM system. For a primer on PKM, check out [[Intro to Personal Knowledge Management]]. And I've noticed that information tends to fall into one of three buckets:\n\n1. Things I may need to reference\n2. Tasks I will need to do\n3. Ideas I want to develop\n\nThe first two are pretty straightforward - I simply capture those into the appropriate bucket. For a long time, I used Evernote as my reference file and OmniFocus as my task list. But when COVID-19 happened and [I reworked my system](https://thesweetsetup.com/mikes-hybrid-bullet-journal-system/), I found a lot of value in having everything in one place. So now, I keep reference material and tasks in the same bucket as the ideas I want to develop. This has a lot of benefits, but I've also discovered I can't treat all my notes the same. I have [a separate, more active system for developing my ideas](https://thesweetsetup.com/mikes-idea-system-2-0/). It's quite a bit more involved, but I believe it's worth it.\n\nIn this article, I want to consider the difference between my old note-taking workflow and the *note-making* that helps me so much in the creative process.\n\n## What is Note-Making?\n\nI first heard the term *note-making* from Nick Milo, who has an excellent YouTube channel called [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA). (He also runs an [excellent workshop](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) that I have gone through as a paying customer.) ALso check out [[Nick Milo's Mindfulness Monday Interview]].\n\nThe basic idea of note-making is that you don't simply just capture your notes and dump them in a library somewhere. Instead, you work on your notes and update them over time. Instead of simply taking notes, you are *crafting them*. Your approach is like that of a skilled craftsman, who knows that within the chunk of wood or stone lies a beautiful carving. You can't see it at the beginning, but as you continue to refine the material you're working with, you start to see it come through.\n\nTo the note-making craftsman, a tool like Obsidian is more of a workbench than a filing cabinet. It's not a place where you hold things until you need them; it's a place where a magical transformation happens. It's where you work your craft and refine your ideas as you turn them into something special worth sharing.\n\nThe end result is something that reflects your current thinking on a topic, comprised of useful facts and information as well as your own opinions on the topic. Something much more beautiful than simply a captured note. Nick calls this type of note a *Map of Content* (or MOC), and describes your role in crafting it as that of a cartographer.\n\nThis analogy immediately resonated with me as I had just finished reading [The Great Mental Models, Volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST) where one of the models described is *The Map is Not the Territory.* You see, whenever you see a map, what are you actually seeing is an opinionated interpretation of what the map maker (cartographer) considered important enough to include. There's no way you can include all the information in a map, so the cartographer is forced to make decisions about what's important, and what's not.\n\nAs you collect notes on a topic, you will eventually get to a point where you feel overwhelmed by everything you've collected. That is the point where you assume the cartographer role and go back to your workbench (MOC) as you craft your thoughts via intentional note-making.\n\nLet me give you an example of an MOC from my own Obsidian vault.\n\nThis is my MOC on the topic of habits:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianmochabits.jpg)\n\nIn this note, there are several things:\n\n- A note at the top as to why this MOC exists\n- A section on the standard habit loop (and image) presented by Charles Duhigg in [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X)\n- An opinion about why I don't like this definition\n- A section on James Clear's 4 Laws of Behavior Change from [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) and why I like this better\n- A section on BJ Fogg's Behavior Model (and accompanying chart) from [Tiny Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Habits-Changes-Change-Everything/dp/0358003326)\n- A section with some links to additional resources/notes that speak to this topic\n- A section on Bible verses that speak to the topic of habits\n\nEvery time I add a note to Obsidian about habits, I look at this MOC and see what I want to add or update. As a result, this note is in constant development and continues to get better and better over time. And I've found that as I force myself to make this note better every time I touch it, my thoughts on the topic continue to gain clarity. The process of forcing my self to add opinion notes and decide what's important helps me to better understand the topic.\n\n## Note-Making vs. Note-Taking\n\nAs I consider my new note-making workflow with the traditional note-taking practice, I notice there are several important differences.\n\nFirst, note-making assumes that your notes are living things. While note-taking, captured notes are static and never change. But with note-taking, your notes are dynamic, and are constantly being updated and refreshed.\n\nAs a result, note-making means your notes are never etched in stone. With note-taking, your notes are finished when they are captured and added to your library. They are there so you can find them if you need them, but they aren't really doing anything while they sit in storage. With note-making, you're notes are in active development. Each note you make is a reflection of the sum total of notes you've collected, and the value is in the relation to your other notes.\n\nWith note-making, relationships are important. Note-taking focuses solely on the content of the active note, but note-making considers the connections to other notes. Note-making recognizes the fact that each note is influenced by the other notes in your library, and takes into consideration the value of previous thoughts and ideas.\n\nThe fundamental approach to your notes is completely different with note-making. Instead of trying to collect everything that you think might be useful someday, you're focused on understanding as much as you can from the ideas that you already have. \n\nI talked with David Sparks about this on [a recent episode of Focused](https://relay.fm/focused/126), and he described the difference in mindset as the dragon and the jeweler. The dragon tries to horde things and sits on top of the diamonds so no one else can get them. But the jeweler is actively working on his diamond so he can make it even better. The dragon may accumulate a lot, but doesn't do anything with it. The jeweler is the one who is getting the real value from working with what he/she already has.\n\n## A Couple Tips for Making Note-Making a Habit\n\nHere's a couple of quick tips I've learned about note-making over the past several months that could help you develop a jeweler's mindset and find more diamonds.\n\n### More Signal, Less Noise\n\nI've intentionally set up my note capturing system so that it doesn't just automatically add everything to my Obsidian vault. I capture notes in two places:\n\n1. My fancy notebook\n2. Drafts on my iPhone (and occasionally Apple Watch)\n \nAt the end of the day, I transfer things over as part of my shutdown routine. This forces me to manually add the notes that I capture to Obsidian, and adds another review step where I can filter out any notes that I don't really want.\n\nThe key here is that I am a *ruthless* about cutting things here. I estimate about 4 out of every 5 things I capture never makes the cut and gets transferred to Obsidian. \n\nThe more distance I get between the moment I capture my idea, usually the less excited I am about it. Every idea seems great when you have it, but not every idea is a good one. By making myself wait, I increase the quality of the ideas that actually end up being developed in Obsidian.\n\nWhich is really the key. I'd rather 5 really great ideas than 500 mediocre ones. When it comes to ideas, quality beats quantity.\n\n### Don't Link Everything\n\nAs your notes library grows, resist the urge to link everything. Bidirectional linking is a really powerful concept, but loses value if it's overused. For example, if I have a note called \"Habits\", My Unlinked Mentions will show me every use of the the word \"habits\" in my entire vault. You can turn any of these into a Linked Mention by clicking the *Link* button, but resist the urge to do so! You don't want *every* mention of the term \"habits\" to show up, you want only the best ones.\n\nI wrote recently about [the power of Obsidian's local graph](https://thesweetsetup.com/the-power-of-obsidians-local-graph/) and how I use it to navigate my notes, but if every page has 100 linked mentions it's difficult to see which ones really matter. Just like the notes themselves, you want quality over quantity here.\n\n### Don't Judge Your Work\n\nAs you see examples of others work, don't compare the results of your note-making practice with anyone else. Your notes are a reflection of your personal journey. Your Habits MOC may look completely different than mine, and that's the point! Add your own opinions and don't try to be someone else. The more authentically you that your notes are, the more value they have.\n\nIf you're unhappy with the output, then change the input. Your brain is always connecting things, so the place to make improvements is to give it better dots to connect. But remember, quality matters more than quantity. Read more books, but don't try to recreate every argument the author makes. Capture the things that stand out to you, then spend some time thinking about them and figure out how and why they matter.\n\n### Automate Your Review\n\nNote-making requires that you look at your notes frequently. I do this as I process my notes in Obsidian, but I still find some of my MOCs don't get much TLC. So recently I installed the Review plugin\n\nOne thing that makes reviewing and updating notes easier is the [Review plugin](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/review-obsidian). (You can also install this in Obsidian by going to the Settings, clicking *Community Plugins*, and browsing for *Review*.) Once installed, you can access the *Command Palette* by using the keyboard shortcut **Command - P** and selecting the *Add this note to daily note for review* option. Select date (the [Natural Language Dates plugin](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian) allows you to use terms like tomorrow, next week, etc.) and a *Review* section will be added to that daily note with a link to your current note. Then when you go to your daily note on that future date, you can just click the link to review your note and make any necessary changes.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Obsidian-Setup":{"title":"","content":"I want to...\n\n- Get plugin recommendations: [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]]\n- Figure out how to use the OBsidian iOS app: [[Using Obsidian on iOS]]\n- Change the theme: [[Changing Your Obsidian Theme]]\n- Capture to my Dropbox vault from Drafts: [[Appending Drafts to Dropbox Daily Notes in Obsidian]]\n- Capture to my iCloud vault from Drafts: [[Capturing to iCloud Drive \u0026 Obsidian from Drafts]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Obsidian-vs.-Roam-Research":{"title":"","content":"\n# Obsidian vs. Roam\n\nThe last 18 months could be classified as \"the rise of the connected note-taking app.\" In the past year, [Roam Research raised $9 million dollars (with a $200 million valuation) ](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps), [Obsidian was nominated for the Product Hunt Golden Kitty award from for the Productivity category](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/announcing-the-2020-golden-kitty-award-winners), and countless other note-taking apps entered the productivity space with their own version of bidirectional linking features. [Even Drafts got an update which allows wiki-style cross-linking](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/cross-linking).\n\nIt's an exciting time for thinkers and creators.\n\nWhile there are lots of apps doing lots of interesting things with notes right now, by far the two most popular options are *Roam Research* and *Obsidian*. In this article, we're going to compare these two connected note-takers and help you choose the right one.\n\n## The Approach\n\nIt's impossible to say \"just use this one\" when it comes to picking the right connected note-taking app for you. On the surface they may seem similar, but there are several important differences that stem from fundamentally different approaches to how your notes are stored and managed. \n\nThere are lots of things you can look at when picking your PKM app, but here are the criteria we used:\n\n- User Interface\n- Graph View\n- Daily Notes\n- Backlinks\n- Sidebar\n- Block Embeds/References\n- Markdown Support\n- Search/Query\n- Daily Notes\n- Tasks\n- Expandability\n- Theming\n- Data Portability\n- Publishing\n- Data Security\n- Mobile Experience\n- Pricing\n\nIn this article, we're going to carefully consider the design choices each app makes in these categories and do our level best to help you pick the right PKM app to fit your workflow.\n\n## User Interface\n\nThe user interface is arguably the most important aspect of a note-taking app, making it easy (or unnecessarily difficult) to capture your ideas and thoughts when you have them.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nAs a pure note-taking app, Obsidian's interface can be confusing. There are a couple of sidebars and a whole bunch of buttons that can get in the way of capturing text into your Obsidian vault.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidian.jpg)\n\nOnce you understand the interface, this really isn't a problem. But I've watched more than one person open Obsidian for the first time and immediately close the app because it looked too complicated.\n\nWhen working with text in Obsidian, there are two different modes you will switch between:\n\n- *Edit Mode* where you write your text\n- *Preview Mode* where you can view the result of your Markdown-formatted text\n\nYou can switch modes by clicking the icon in the top-right of the document pane, but if you switch back and forth a lot this can be a little tedious. You can actually hold the *Command* key when you click on the Preview icon to open the preview in a new pane, which gives you a side-by-side view of your note.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiansidebyside.jpg)\n\nI actually prefer to write this way as the preview gets updated in real-time. But it's not entirely discoverable for a brand new user.\n\n### Roam\n\nThe user interface is where Roam Research really shines. It has a clever way of displaying the raw text when you click on a line, then rendering the preview when you switch the focus to another line.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamresearch.jpg)\n\nThis is a great way to work with your text, and eliminates a lot of the friction if you do more than just text. \n\nRoam also includes a section at the bottom of each note which shows the backlinks, making them more easily discoverable for new users. We'll dig deeper into backlinks in the next section, but it's worth calling out here because being able to see and link related pages is an important of the user interface and Roam does this better.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Graph View\n\nThe *Graph* is kind of like a mind map, showing all of the connections between all of the notes. It can be useful to help see links between notes and ideas, but can also be overwhelming when you have a lot of notes.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian's graph view is incredible. Not only is it super-fast, but you can apply filters, create groups, and even change the look and functionality of the graph itself:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiangraph.jpg)\n\nBut the real magic in Obsidian happens in the local graph.\n\nYou can open a local graph by clicking on the three dots in the upper-right of the active note and selecting *Open local graph* from the menu. This opens a simpler graph which shows the notes in your vault that link to the active note, and the notes that the active note links to. These bidirectional links allow you to navigate between your notes by clicking on the dots in the local graph.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianlocalgraph.jpg)\n\nThe local graph automatically updates when you open a new active note, and it can be stored in the sidebar so you can access it quickly.\n\n### Roam\n\nThe *Graph Overview* in Roam gives you a look at the connections between all the notes in you library, but is completely unusable if you have a large number of notes. You can see the connections when you hover over a circle for a specific note, but they seem to be randomly spaced and there isn't a great way to navigate between them.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamgraph.png)\n\nThere are also no filters to help clean up the Graph overview, and it's much slower in our testing than the Graph View in Obsidian.\n\nRoam does have a button on each note page that you can click to \"Open a graph of this page in the sidebar,\" but it doesn't update as you navigate through your notes. It is literally a static graph view of the current note and the links between other notes in your Roam database. While it can serve it's purpose, we feel the Graph View in Obsidian is much more polished - and much more useful.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are the foundation of a connected note-taking app, allowing you to navigate between your notes like a personal wiki. Both Roam and Obsidian take this wiki-style linking a step further though, allowing you to surface *unlinked mentions* of your currently selected note and make connections with a click. This allows you to intentionally connect your notes in new and more meaningful ways, which can be especially useful for creatives who want to develop their ideas.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nLinking to pages in Obsidian is simple: just use `[[pagetitle]]` anywhere in your text to add a link to the note with that page title. Obsidian's auto-complete helps you find the page you want to link to, or you can create a link to new page by entering a text string that doesn't currently exist in a note title. You can click on these links to navigate to that page when in Preview mode, and the connection also shows up in the graph view. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianautocomplete.jpg)\n\nYou can also use Obsidian's auto-complete to link to headers in the document by using  `#`, or link to a specific block by using `^`.\n\nThe problem with backlinks in Obsidian lies in how it handles unlinked mentions. Backlinks (linked mentions and unlinked mentions) are both located in the sidebar and easy to miss. Once you know where to look it's not a big deal, but we prefer the way Roam puts backlinks at the bottom of the note.\n\n### Roam\n\nJust like Obsidian, Roam allows you to create a ink to another page using `[[pagetite]]`. The big difference is the addition of the linked mentions and unlinked mentions at the bottom of your currently selected note. This may seem like a small detail, but it makes finding and creating links incredibly easy in Roam since it's hard to miss. And the more that you use intentionally link your notes together, the more valuable your web of ideas becomes.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/autocompleteroam.jpg)\n\nRoam also does a *much* better job handling backlinks to individual blocks. Unlike Obsidian (which uses individual text files), Roam is a database. This means that each individual block in Roam is it's own entry in the database, and makes it much easier to link atomic note elements together. We'll dig into this in the next section on block references, but Roam is built to make the most of this essential feature.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Sidebar\n\nAnother important part of the user interface is the *sidebar*. This can display related information to the note you're currently editing and serve as a collecting place for related notes that you want to view together.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nThe sidebar in Obsidian is where much of the magic happens. It can not only show you the linked and unlinked mentions for the note you are currently editing, but can also do things like display an outline of your note broken down by header and give you quick access to your tags. You can even keep a local graph in the sidebar of linked notes that updates when you open a new note.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiansidebar.jpg)\n\nUsing third-party plugins can extend the sidebar capabilities even further. For example, the Calendar plugin allows you to navigate a calendar view and quickly jump to Daily Notes pages for a specific date. Plugins are a whole separate section, but they can extend the capabilities of the sidebar in Obsidian in some really cool ways/\n\n### Roam\n\nThe sidebar in Roam serves a little bit of a different purpose. Instead of panes where you can choose what information you want to show, the primary role of the sidebar in Roam is to serve as a collecting place for related information. For example, hold the *Shift* key while you click a link and the note opens in the sidebar instead of navigating away from the note you are currently on.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsidebar.jpg)\n\nPutting related notes int he sidebar also makes it easier when you want to embed a block from one note into another one. Just hold down the *Option* key and drag the block from the sidebar into the note in the main window and the block will be embedded automatically.\n\nThe big difference here is that the sidebar in Roam has a very specific function: to aid you in your research. The design choices about the sidebar reflect this: the sidebar is for the bits and pieces, the main window is for your active note. There is no such distinction in Obsidian, but the flexibility it gives you in designing your sidebar layout makes up for this in time. While there's a lot to be said for Roam's focused simplicity, when you start extending Obsidian's capabilities using plugins the sidebar becomes an essential tool\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Block Embeds/References\n\nOccasionally, you might want to link to a specific section of a note. These fundamental building blocks of notes are called *blocks*, and being able to link and embed them in other notes is a powerful benefit of connected note-taking apps.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nTo embed something in Obsidian, you simply put an `!` character before the `[[pagetitle]]`. This tells Obsidian that instead of just linking to the page, you want to embed it in the current location in the active note. You can take this even further by using a `#` to embed a specific header or `^` to embed a specific block. Using auto-complete like this make block embeds in Obsidian even easier than they are in Roam.\n\nLinking and embedding blocks is kind of a hacky workaround in Obsidian. Since it's based on individual text files, the way Obsidian connects to individual blocks is to add a weird identifier at the end of the block that it can use to locate it again:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianbolck.jpg)\n\nThis is fine for embedding blocks into other notes. Where this really falls down though is with block references.\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to see block references is in the backlinks section in the sidebar. This isn't a problem if you have very small (atomic) notes in your Obsidian vault, but it gets tricky if you have longer notes with lots of blocks you'd like to reference in other notes. Instead of quickly being able to find the few notes that reference a specific block in a list, you have to comb through *all* the links to the entire page.\n\nThis is Obsidian's achilee's heel, and forces you to keep a large number of short notes in your vault instead of a small number of large notes. You can work around it, but it's annoying.\n\n### Roam\n\nBlock embeds and references in Roam are easy. Because everything in Roam is stored in a database, there is no distinction between individual notes and blocks and everything can be broken down into more atomic units.\n\nYou can use a block reference in Roam by: \n\n- Using `((` and searching your database for the block you want to link\n- Right-clicking on a block and selecting *Copy Block Reference*\n- Dragging a block from a note in your sidebar into the main note window\n\nBecause Roam converts text to preview the moment you deselect the line, a block reference in Roam looks very much like a block embed in Obsidian. It shows you the contents of the original block, but if you go back to the original block you will also see a number to the right of the block. This indicates the number of references to the block in your entire Roam Research database, and clicking on it will show all references in line:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamblock.jpg)\n\nThis is incredibly useful, and a major reason to choose Roam Research for your PKM needs. The more you use block references like this, the more powerful you realize this feature is.\n\nBlock Embeds in Roam are also better than they are in Obsidian, allowing you created a linked copy of the block in the current note. The difference here is that instead of merely pointing back to the original block and displaying the contents, a block embed allows you to edit the contents of the block right in your new note. When you do, the original block (and all other embedded copies of the block) are updated as well.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Markdown Support\n\nBoth apps support Markdown formatting in plain text. This allows you to style your text (for example, for publishing to the web), but means your plain text notes are compatible with any text editor on the planet.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian is simply an interface for plain text files that are stored on your computer, and supports standard Markdown formatting. Many themes will have syntax highlighting to make it easier to see your Markdown-formatted text, but the Markdown that Obsidian supports will be viewable in any other text editor.\n\nThis is unremarkable, but the way it should be. \n\n### Roam\n\nRoam, on the other hand, supports a weird flavor of Markdown. Most of it will be familiar (i.e. `#` for headers, bulleted lists, etc.), but it also inexplicably changes some very familiar Markdown formatting. For example, standard Markdown lets you use `**` (or `__`) for bold and `*` (or `_`) for italic formatting. But in Roam, you have to use `**` for bold and `__` for italic. This goes directly against the standard Markdown convention of double characters for bold text and single for italic. \n\nI don't understand why the Roam team made this choice. You can argue that you'll just get used to it, but not if you do writing in any other plain text editors that support standard Markdown formatting. This is inexcusable, and a dealbreaker for many.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Search/Query\n\nSearch used to be the only practical way to surface your notes after you had captured them. This has changed with the advent of bidirectional linking in connected note-taking apps, but search is still useful when you need to locate something specific. In addition, queries can help you comb through your entire database of notes quickly and easily return notes that match certain criteria, like tasks due on a certain date or articles that are currently in progress.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nAfter spending some time using search and queries in both apps, I have toa dmit that search in Obsidian feel secondary. It lets you search your library using criteria like `path:`, `file:`, and `tag:`. You can also combine search modifiers to quickly find the needle in the digital haystack.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiansearch.jpg)\n\nIt feels very much like a standard boolean search, but doesn't do a great job of showing the context of your search results. You can embed a search or query in a note, but the annoyances with displaying note context make this... not great.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam's minimal interface has a search bar at the top to help you quickly find anything you might be looking for, but the real magic happens with Roam's *Queries*. Queries require a specific formatting to be used, but are incredibly powerful because they embed the blocks that match your criteria in the page. For example, a simple query that return everything with a tag of `#Quote` looks something like this:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsearch.jpg)\n\nIn addition to search and queries, Roam also has *Filters* that can limit what data you see when looking at your note. Click the funnel icon and you can choose what you want to include or remove using the filter.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Daily Notes\n\nBoth Obsidian and Roam have support fora feature called *Daily Notes*. Daily Notes are the digital equivalent of the Bullet Journal's daily page, serving as a place to capture bits and pieces of information before you process them and decide where they belong. \n\n### Obsidian\n\nIf you open a fresh install of Obsidian, you won't see the Daily Notes feature as it's not on by default. It must be enabled by going to **Settings --\u003e Core Plugins** and toggling on **Daily Notes**. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage, as it's not on by default but also allows you to limit the features you don't use to keep Obsidian from getting unwieldy.\n\nOnce you have Daily Notes enabled, an icon will appear on the left sidebar that you can click to go straight to today's Daily Note:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiandailynotes.jpg)\n\nThis opens up today's daily note, and you can capture text that gets linked to that specific date.\n\nAnd out of the box, that's all it does. But with the addition of other plugins, Daily Notes can get a lot more powerful.\n\nFor example, the Calendar plugin gives you a monthly calendar view that you can use to jump to a specific date (either past or in the future). You can also use the templates feature (another Core Plugin) to auto-populate your new daily notes with text templates, [like I do for journaling](https://thesweetsetup.com/journaling-using-daily-questions-in-obsidian/).\n\nThe big limitation with Obsidian's Daily Notes is in the way it surfaces tasks (or rather doesn't). We look at tasks in another section, but Daily Notes are an important piece to task management and it's a little bit lacking in Obsidian. You can link tasks to a specific date, but because they aren't displayed in the main note it's very easy to miss them.\n\n### Roam\n\nDaily Notes are a very important part of the Roam Research experience. In fact, the app opens straight to your Daily Notes page for today when you log in.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamdailynotes.jpg)\n\nWith Roam, there is a specific workflow you are guided into:\n\n1. capture things on your daily notes page\n2. embed/reference them somewhere else later\n\nThe way Roam handles queries and block references/embeds, the focus is clearly on just capturing things to your Daily Notes page - not on deciding which note they belong with. You can easily do that after the fact using the sidebar, or not at all if you prefer and just surface things using queries. This makes for some [very interesting journaling workflows](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-i-use-roam-research-for-journaling/).\n\nBy opening to today's daily note, Roam also makes it a better option for managing tasks than Obsidian. In addition to showing linked tasks (the ones due that day) on the main note in the linked mentions section, it also shows that day first thing when you open the app so you don't miss them. Of course, that still assumes you are opening the app every day.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Tasks\n\nPlain text task management is nothing new. But bidirectional linking opens up some interesting new possibilities, like a digital bullet journal or being able to link directly to the article you're writing in the same application.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nYou can create a task in Obsidian by using the `- [ ]` formatting, which makes it possible to check off the task as complete in Preview Mode.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidiantask.jpg)\n\nYou can also link a task to a specific date using the `[[pagetitle]]` syntax. Just insert the name of the daily note you want to link the task to, and the task will show up in the linked mentions on that date. It's not great, but it works.\n\nUnfortunately, tasks don't feel like they belong in Obsidian. But there are lots of third-party plugins that try to fix this in lots of different ways, like:\n\n- the Slated plugin which adds a bunch of additional features to task management in Obsidian\n- the Todoist plugin that allows you to embed tasks from Todoist using filters\n- the Kanban plugin which allows you to create cards for your tasks and link to pages from the card titles\n\nBut the vanilla Obsidian app leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam seems to be built with task management in mind. From any block, you can use the keyboard shortcut **Command + Enter** to cycle between a todo, a completed todo, and a plain text block. You can also use the slash command in the block to quickly access the date picker and select a due date for the task, which creates a page link to that day's daily note in Roam:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamtask-scaled.jpg)\n\nFrom here, surfacing your tasks when they are due is easy. Roam opens to today's daily note by default, and your tasks that are due are surfaced in the linked mentions section at the bottom of the main note window.\n\nYou can also use tags and Roam's powerful queries to cobble together your own [GTD-style task management system in Roam](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-roam-research-for-gtd-style-task-management/).\n\nIt's still not as nice as a dedicated task management app like [Things](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-personal-gtd-app-suite/), but if you have only basic task management needs or want to link your tasks to the documents you're working on, Roam is a decent option.\n\n### Winner: Roam\n\n## Expandability\n\nBoth apps can do a lot out of the box, but you may want to customize the app you use to fit your specific workflow. With a few tweaks, you can turn your note-taking app into a productivity powerhouse.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian ships with standard feature set, but it is easily expandable using *plugins*. There are two kines of plugins:\n\n- *Core plugins*, which ship with the app\n- *Community plugins*, which are developed by third-parties and installable via a public directory\n\nAs of this writing, the Obsidian API is not officially released (at least per the [public development roadmap](https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap)). But it's still amazing what you can do currently with community plugins. There are currently 178 plugins listed in the directory, which can do things like:\n\n- Push a backup of your entire vault to GitHub\n- Create editable kanban boards\n- Automatically log completed tasks from Things\n- Use natural language for dates\n- much, much more\n\nIt's impossible to overstate how awesome plugins are in Obsidian. Some of the functionality third-party developers have been able to add is astounding. It takes some trial and error to figure out which ones will fit for you, but the quality is great and the directory keeps getting bigger.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam doesn't have plugin like Obsidian, but you can embed scripts and code directly into Roam to extend it's capability. One of the most popular Roam \"extensions\" is called [Roam42](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roamhacker/page/UeoxCm8rm). Roam 42 gives you a lot of extra stuff Roam doesn't support by default, like:\n\n- SmartBlocks workflows to use your text in some pretty incredible ways\n- deep navigation using the keyboard\n- natural language processing for dates\n\nTo \"install\" code snippets like Roam42, you copy a script and embed it in a code block in your database. There are obviously some security risks inherent with this, but it's currently the only way to extend Roam's capabilities.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian (by a landslide)\n\n## Theming\n\nIn addition to extending functionality, you can also customize the look and feel of each app using themes. These themes are built using CSS, which means you have the ability to tweak them exactly the way you want - with a little bit of web development knowledge.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nInstalling themes in Obsidian is incredibly easy. You can actually access a public directory of themes right from the app by going to **Settings --\u003e Appearance --\u003e Community Themes**. You can select a theme to install it, or preview any of the themes in the directory if you're not quite sure.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianthemes.jpg)\n\nAll of the themes that you download are kept in a hidden folder on your computer, and you can edit the CSS directly in a text editor like SublimeText or BBEdit.\n\nYou can also create your own *CSS Snippets* that can be toggled on or off from **Settings --\u003e Appearance**. But there are a lot of great themes that also have an associated plugin that allow you to tweak the visual settings without touching any actual code.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam doesn't have a public directory of themes you can access directly from the app, but it does allow you to make the same kind of changes by pasing a CSS code block on your `roam/css` page.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamtheme.jpg)\n\nYou can have many of these code snippets active at once, which can cause conflicts if you're not sure which ones are enabled (you way you turn them off is to switch the code snippet from *CSS* to *Clojure*). But if you want to tweak any of these settings yourself, you're going to have to know your way around CSS.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Data Portability\n\nThe beauty of plain text is that it is timeless, giving you access to your notes on any platform and any device. By keeping your notes in plain text, you ensure future compatibility should you decide to switch apps down the road.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian as an application sits on top local files stored on your computer. The files themselves are not imported into Obsidian, they are simply opened and viewed there. That means that if you ever decide to stop using Obsidian, what you are left with is a bunch of local plain text files. While some features in Obsidian may use special formatting, the foundation of your notes documents is standard Markdown that can be opened and edited in any other plain text editor.\n\nIn terms of futureproofing, it doesn't get any safer than this.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam also uses plain text, but stores it in a proprietary database format. You can export your data from Roam as either separate Markdown files or a single JSON file, but while your data is in Roam it is still in a proprietary format.\n\nI've personally used Roam's export feature and it worked fine. There's no reason to think you won't be able to get your notes out of Roam if decide to switch connected note-taking apps, but recognize that there is an additional step involved and it isn't as simple as it is in Obsidian.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Publishing\n\nOccasionally, you may want to share your notes with someone directly. Publishing your notes allows you to send a public link to someone so they can access them directly via a web browser.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian has an add-on service called *Publish* that you can buy directly from the developers. It is currently $8/month per site (billed annually), and allows you to publish your notes directly to the web. The service gives you a *publish.obsidian.md* site, but you can also use a custom domain if you want.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obsidianpublish.jpg)\n\nThe site itself displays the notes that you choose to publish, alongside the local graph view of the currently selected note. You can even password protect your site if you want to control who has access to it.\n\nThis is pretty brilliant way to monetize the application without charging people for features if they don't need them. \n\nOne note: you can't publish directly to a Wordpress site from Obsidian like you can from Ulysses, but the standard Markdown formatting means it is easy to copy and paste your text when you're done writing in Obsidian.\n\n### Roam\n\nSharing notes in Roam is a little more complicated.\n\nFirst, you need to understand that data in Roam is not end-to-end encrypted (more on this later). That might not be such a big deal, except that when you share a note in Roan, *all of the data in your entire graph gets loaded in your visitor's browser*. There's even a warning if you toggle on the setting for sharing individual pages:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roamsharing.jpg)\n\nThe alternative is to make your entire graph public, but if you keep notes on things you don't want to share with the world you'll need to keep that info in a separate graph (meaning it's unlinkable from the graph that you share).\n\nLike Obsidian, Roam also doesn't have a way to publish directly to Wordpress. But it also doesn't use standard Markdown, which means you can't simply copy and paste either. It seems like the Roam team is focused on developing more multi-user features, but at the moment it's not a great publishing or sharing platform for most people.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Data Security\n\nYour notes should be private unless you decide to share them. Plain and simple.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nIf you're concerned about the security of your notes, Obsidian is the obvious choice for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, all your notes in Obsidian are really just text files that are stored locally on your computer. They're not shared publicly *anywhere* by default unless your vault is located in a shared folder like Dropbox or iCloud Drive.\n\nSecond, the Obsidian Sync service (another add-on which currently costs $4/month, paid annually) is end-to-end encrypted. Whatever data you decide to send to the Obsidian servers is encrypted from the moment it leaves you hard drive to the moment you download it on a new device.\n\nIt's also important to note that you don't need to use Obsidian's Sync service. But it is the best way to sync data if you're going to use the Obsidian mobile app.\n\n### Roam\n\nWith Roam Research, everything is stored on their servers. There's also no two-factor authentication for logging in, and no end-to-end encryption of your stored data.\n\nFor some, that's not a big deal. If someone wants to steal my sermon notes, I don't really care. But if you store sensitive information in your notes, Roam's \"security by obscurity\" is not going to be enough.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Mobile Experience\n\nWhile the computer is the primary place to interact with your notes with both of these apps, occasionally you may want to access your notes on the go.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nAs mentioned above, Obsidian sits on top of plain text files on your computer. Which means the way you can access your notes on your iOS devices is fairly limited (at least until the iOS app is officially released).\n\nOne easy way to see and edit your notes on the go is to keep your notes in a cloud folder and access them via an iOS text editor. For example, I keep my vault in my Dropbox folder, which allows me to access my notes in apps like 1Writer. Because Dropbox sync is so solid, any changes are instantly sent back to my Mac and instantly show up in Obsidian.\n\nThere is also an iOS app in development, but it is currently in closed beta as of this writing. It's amazingly functional and very solid for such a young app, but early signs indicate this could be a very pleasant iOS experience for Obsidian users - assuming that they are willing to pay for Obsidian Sync to keep their vault up-to-date between their different devices.\n\n### Roam\n\nRoam Research is not made for mobile access. Plain and simple. There is no mobile app for Roam, and the full site in a mobile browser is not a pleasant experience. \n\nRoam does have a mobile stylesheet that changes the main page from the standard Daily Notes page to a *Quick Capture* page. Quick Capture lets you jot down text, todos, links, and images and add them as blocks directly to your Daily Notes pages so you can process them when you get back to your computer. You can choose the graph you want and select the page you want to add the block to, but it's really just for capturing things on the go.\n\nBottom line: if you want to access your notes from your iPhone, Roam isn't a great option.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian\n\n## Pricing\n\nWhile we all love a good deal, ultimately you want to make sure that the connected note-taker you decide to use has a clear business model that can support future development. And of course, the price you pay must be reflective of the value that you get form using the application itself.\n\n### Obsidian\n\nObsidian's pricing model is *very* interesting.\n\nThe app itself is actually free for personal use. You can download the app, point it at your notes stored locally on your device, and use it forever without paying a dime. That would normally make us a little nervous, but Obsidian has a very clear monetization strategy by offering add-ons for purchase.\n\nThere are currently two different add-ons available for Obsidian:\n\n- *Publish*, which allows you to share your notes publicly via the web for $8/month (current pricing, paid annually)\n- *Sync*,which allows you to access your vault on your mobile devices and includes 1 year of revision history for $4/month (current pricing, paid annually)\n\nBoth of these services are well implemented, and allow users who need them to support Obsidian's development. Note that these add-ons are *not* the same as the plugins mentioned earlier, which are accessible in the free version. And if you don't need Sync or Publish but just want to support the Obsidian team, you can do that as well via the web.\n\n### Roam\n\nLet's get this out of the way: Roam is *really* expensive.\n\nThere is no free version of Roam, and pricing begins at $15/month for the \"Pro\" version. If you decide to pay yearly it's $165, and there is a \"Believer\" plan that is $500 for 5 years. The Pro version includes a 30 day free trial (you get charged on day 31), but it's a pretty big investment. By comparison, if you signed up for both the Sync and Publish add-ons using current pricing, you'd be paying $144/year for Obsidian.\n\nIt's hard to make a blanket statement about whether Roam's hefty price tag is worth it. If you're all in with Roam it probably is. But if you're just getting started with connected note-taking and dipping your toes in the PKM waters, it's hard to justify.\n\n### Winner: Obsidian","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Productivity":{"title":"","content":"I want to...\n\n- Use templates: [[Using Templates in Obsidian]]\n- Set up keyboard shortcuts: [[Keyboard Hotkeys and The Command Pallette]]\n- Use the Graph view: [[The Power of the Local Graph]]\n- Leverage callback URLs: [[Callback URLs in Obsidian]]\n- Split text into separate notes: [[Splitting Notes in Obsidian]]\n- Leverage metadata to organize my motes: [[YAML \u0026 Dataview]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Splitting-Notes-in-Obsidian":{"title":"","content":"\n[https://vimeo.com/571367259](https://vimeo.com/571367259)\n\nOne of the key things you need to understand about obsidian if you really want to make the most of it is the concept of *atomic note taking.* The TL;DR is to break down your notes into the smallest possible pieces which allows them to be linked together and makes them visible inside of the [Local Graph view](https://thesweetsetup.com/the-power-of-obsidians-local-graph/).\n\nThis can come in handy when you're navigating the notes inside your Obsidian vault. But this is different that the default way most of us have become used to taking notes. If you're like me, most of the time when you're taking notes, you just jot down a bunch of things at once. But with Obsidian, you can actually break apart those notes after the fact and effortlessly link those notes together.\n\nFor this example, let's use this note that I have here for the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. I'll start with this really big note of everything from the book but then I want to break apart individual pieces of this into their own specific notes. And there's a couple ways that we can do this. \n\n## Simple: Note Composer\n\nThe first way is to use the *Note Composer* plugin, which is a core plugin allowing you to both split apart notes and to combine notes. But for the purposes of atomic note taking, we're going to look at breaking apart notes. \n\nTo enable the *Note Composer* core plugin, first click the *Settings* button down here in the left sidebar,\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes1.jpg)\n\nNext, click on *Core Plugins* and make sure that note composer is toggled on. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes2.jpg)\n\nOnce this is toggled on, you can activate the Note Composer actions from Obsidian. So let's close our settings, go back to our note for *Atomic Habits*, and select a part of the note we want to break apart into a separate note (like the section right here on the British cycling team). Now we can break this into its own specific note by right clicking and selecting *Extract current selection*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes3.jpg)\n\n(I can also access this by going to the Command Palette by hitting `Command-P` and searching for *note composer*.)\n\nWhen you select *Extract current selection*, Obsidian will ask you which file you want to send that selection too. Select an existing note to append the text to that note (add it to the bottom), or type a name for a new file like *British Cycling Team* and hit `Enter` to create a new note. Once you do, the new note will be created and the selection will become the contents of the new note.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes4.jpg)\n\nAnd in the original *Atomic Habits* note, the original selection is gone  and in its place is an internal link to the *British Cycling Team* note. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes5.jpg)\n\nThis link connects the two notes using bidirectional linking, and allows me to navigate between these notes using the Graph view\n\n## Advanced: Note Refactor\n\nBut there's another plugin we can use to break things into separate notes that's a little bit more powerful. It's kind of like *Note Composer+*, and it's called *Note Refactor*. This is a community plugin, so to enable Note Refactor, you need to go to *Settings*, then go to Community Plugins, and click *Browse*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes6.jpg)\n\nNext, search for *Note Refactor* and make sure that it is both installed and enabled.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes7.jpg)\n\nOnce it's active, you can access *Note Refactor* via the *Command Palette*. This plugin breaks apart your notes as well, but it does a lot of other really cool things. For example, you can take a lengthy note and break apart every header section in the note as it's own note. Let's use this note for *The Great Mental Models, Volume 1*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes8.jpg)\n\nEach third level header in the book (indicated the the `###` at the beginning of the line) covers a specific mental model. So let's say I want to break each one of those mental models apart as its own separate note using *Note Refactor*. To do this, I just hit `Command-P` to activate the Command Pallete, search for *Note Refactor*, and select the option  *Split note by headings - H3*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes9.jpg)\n\nNow when I hit Enter, a whole bunch of new notes get created and each one of those new notes is now linked to inside of my original note. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/splitnotes10.jpg)\n\nAnd because those are individual notes, I can connect those notes to other notes which may reference those ideas, allowing me to build a spiderweb of backlinks from the notes in my library.\n\n*(If you want more plugin recommendations, check out [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]]).*","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Start-Here":{"title":"","content":"![[General PKM]]\n\n\n![[Obsidian Setup]]\n\n\n![[Productivity]]\n\n\n![[Journaling]]\n\n\n![[Writing]]\n\n\n![[Task Management]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Syncing-and-Embedding-Tasks-with-Todoist":{"title":"","content":"\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoisthero.jpg)\n\nObsidian has some basic support for tasks built in. But if you rely on notifications for when to do what, then you're going to need a dedicated task manager. Fortunately, there's a [Todoist plugin](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin) for Obsidian which allows you to have the best of both worlds - you can capture tasks into Todoist directly and get notified on your devices when it's time to do a task, but you can also embed those tasks into an Obsidian so you can associate them with a particular project. In this post, I'm going to show you how to use the Todoist Sync community plugin to embed tasks using Todoist's filters in Obsidian. \n\n## Setting up the Todoist Sync Plugin\n\nFirst, click on the gear icon in the lower left to access the Obsidian Settings:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist1.jpg)\n\nNext, go to *Community plugins* and click on *Browse*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist2.jpg)\n\nSearch for *Todoist*, and select the [Todoist Sync plugin](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin). Click on the plugin, then click *Install* and then *Enable*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist3.jpg)\n\nFor the plugin to sync with the Todoist app you're going to need your Todoist API token. You can click the link access your API token on the web, or you can open the Todoist app and go to *Settings --\u003e Integrations* and scroll down to the bottom. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist4.jpg)\n\nOnce you find your API token, copy it to your clipboard and go back into Obsidian. Paste the API token into the field and then click *Submit*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist5.jpg)\n\nOnce you have your API token set, you're ready to start using the plugin.\n\n## Embedding Todoist Tasks in a Note\n\nYou can embed Todoist tasks inside any note file, like this blank one I have for the [Focused podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused) that I do with David Sparks. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist6.jpg)\n\nTo embed Todoist tasks into a note, we use the following code:\n\n\u003e ```todoist\n\u003e {\n\u003e \"name\": \"(NAME)\"\n\u003e \"filter\":  \"(FILTER)\"\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\nThe variables we can change here are *name* and *filter*. The *name* is simply the title that will be displayed at the top of the section once we embed the tasks. The *filter* is any valid Todoist filter. If you're new to Todoist filters, check out [this article by Jeff Abbott](https://thesweetsetup.com/an-introduction-to-filters-in-todoist/) as an introduction or the [official documentation on the Todoist website](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters).\n\nHere's a couple of examples:\n\nIf I wanted to show all tasks that were either due today or overdue, I would use this code:\n\n\u003e ```todoist\n\u003e {\n\u003e \"name\": \"Today \u0026 Overdue\"\n\u003e \"filter\":  \"(today | overdue)\"\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\nOnce I switch to Preview mode, the embedded tasks look something like this:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist7.jpg)\n\nIf you want to filter by project you can do that by using `#` and then the project name. So if I wanted to show all tasks associated with the NeuYear Focused calendar project, I would use this code:\n\n\u003e ```todoist\n\u003e {\n\u003e \"name\": \"Focused Calendar\"\n\u003e \"filter\":  \"#Focused 2022 Calendar\"\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\nThis code would render in Preview mode like this:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist8.jpg)\n\nIf you want to filter by tag you can do that using `@` and then the tag name. So if I wanted to show all tasks associated with the *focused* tag, I would use this code:\n\n\u003e ```todoist\n\u003e {\n\u003e \"name\": \"All Focused tasks\"\n\u003e \"filter\":  \"@focused\"\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\nThis code would render in Preview mode like this:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist9.jpg)\n\nWhat's great about these embedded tasks is that you can check the boxes to complete the tasks and the status instantly syncs back to Todoist.\n\n## Adding Tasks from the Command Palette\n\nYou can also add tasks to Todoist straight from Obsidian by using the *Command Palette*. Just hit *Command - P* to open the Command Palette and type `Todoist`. What you'll see is a complete list of the commands enabled by the Todoist Sync plugin:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist10.jpg)\n\nFrom here, we can:\n- Refresh the metadata (pull in any changes from Todoist that isn't syncing)\n- Add a Todoist task\n- Add a Todoist task with a callback URL link to the current Obsidian note\n\nSelect *Add a Todoist task* and you'll get a popup window which you can use to add the task name and any additional metadata. Here's an example:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist11.jpg)\n\nOnce you add the information you want, click *Add*.\n\nYou may notice that the task doesn't immediately show up in your embedded Todoist task list, even if it falls into the requirements for the active filter. To get it to show up, simply click the *Refresh* button of the embedded Todoist task list in Preview mode.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist12.jpg)\n\nYou can also set the plugin to automatically refresh and customize the time interval in the Todoist Sync plugin settings.\n\n*(If you want more plugin recommendations, check out [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]]).*","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Task-Management":{"title":"","content":"I want to... \n\n- Embed tasks from my task manager: [[Syncing and Embedding Tasks with Todoist]]\n- Take good meeting notes in Obsidian [[Meeting Notes in Obsidian]]\n- Timblock my day in Obsidian: [[Timeblocking in Obsidian]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/The-Power-of-the-Local-Graph":{"title":"","content":"\nThe promise of apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) is to give you a tool for connected note-taking. (If you're wondering which one is right for you, check out [[Obsidian vs. Roam Research]]). With this approach, you can see the commonalities between your thoughts as your notes bump up against one another, allowing you to see connections and discover new insights. These connections are usually represented in some sort of *Graph View*, which can look like a complex spiderweb of notes and ideas. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graph.jpg)\n\nIt looks impressive, but in reality, it's often kind of useless.\n\nIn this article, I'll show you how to leverage the *Local Graph* in Obsidian to navigate your notes. And if you prefer to watch, here's a video.\n\n[embed]https://vimeo.com/549340797[/embed]\n\n## Note Linking \u0026 The Graph View\n\nAt the heart of the Graph View is the concept of note linking. By making connections between notes, you are saying that these two ideas or notes have something in common and belong together. The more ideas you link together, the more they impact one another and shape the eventual output ‚Äî whether that be a blog post, podcast, video, or simply your developed thoughts on a topic.\n\nTruth be told, your brain is doing this exact thing *all the time.* It's really good at connecting the dots you collect and making new things out of them, but it may not feel natural at first.\n\nI first stumbled on this idea in *[Steal Like an Artist](https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/ref=nosim\u0026tag=sweetsetup-20)* by Austin Kleon. Before reading this book, I couldn't describe myself as \"creative.\" I used to get frustrated because every time I tried to create, I'd eventually notice that my work ended up being heavily influenced by something I had read, seen, or heard somewhere else. I assumed that I just didn't have the ability, the creative gene, to make anything inspired like so many of my internet heroes did.\n\nBut Austin Kleon helped me to realize that creativity is *not* coming up with something completely original. It's simply remixing the things that you take in. In fact, nothing is completely original. When you create something, you are simply connecting the dots in ways that haven't been connected before.\n\nI decided that I wasn't going to worry about judging the output anymore. I was simply going to do my best to collect new dots and let my brain connect them however it was inclined to do so. Whatever came out was simply the logical result of the dots I had collected. I had a formula for my creativity. I was going to improve my creative output by simply collecting better inputs.\n\nWhat I love about the Graph View is that it allows you to visualize these connections that already exist in your brain. It also allows you to manipulate the dots and connect them in new and interesting ways. The more interesting dots you collect and connect, the more valuable the output ‚Äî whether that be a blog post, a podcast episode, or simply a way of working through your thoughts on a particular topic.\n\nAt the heart of this graph view is the concept of *bidirectional linking*, which is actually a lot more than just a link from one page to another.\n\n## Bidirectional Linking \u003e Wiki-Style Crosslinking\n\nNote that bidirectional linking is *not* the same as wiki-style linking, which many plain text apps like nvALT have supported for a long time. You use special characters (oftentimes double brackets, just like in Obsidian) to create a link to another page, but the important difference here is that the link only goes one direction. \n\nAs a basic example, let's say you have a note that serves as a table of contents for a library of other notes. In this table of contents note are wiki-style crosslinks to a bunch of other notes. This allows you to navigate to your individual notes from the table of contents, but *not the other way around*. Yes, you have a link between the notes, but it's only useful from a single direction. It's like a one-way street in your brain. It's fine if you always approach that note from a single direction, but it's not great if you want the freedom to explore.\n\nYes, you can turn this into a two-way street by adding a link back to the original page, but it more than doubles the amount of work when adding a link if you want this kind of connection for every link you add:\n\n1. You have to create the link from Note A to Note B\n2. You have to open Note B and a link back to Note A\n3. You have to go back to Note A and continue what you were doing\n\nThis is too much friction for me personally. I find I forget to add the links back to the original note more often than I actually add them, which makes my sad, broken cross-reference library more frustrating than useful.\n\nBut this is solved with bidirectional links because the link back to the referring note gets added automatically.\n\nWith a bidirectional link, the relationship between the linked notes is visible in the *Linked Mentions* section of **both** notes. This gives you the freedom to follow your thoughts in either direction, and is visible not only in the big graph view in Obsidian but also the *Local Graph*.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is where the magic happens.\n\n## Using The Local Graph in Obsidian\n\nYou can access the Local Graph in Obsidian by clicking **More Options** for a note (the three dots in the upper-right) and selecting **Open Local Graph**.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianhome.jpg)\n\nThis opens a new pane displaying the Local Graph for the note. You can drag it into either the left or right sidebar (depending on your preference) so you can always see it, and it will automatically update as you select different notes. You can click on a new note from the *File Explorer* in the left sidebar, or you can click on one of the dots displayed in the Local Graph to jump straight to that note.\n\nAnd this is where things start to get interesting.\n\nIf you make good connections between your notes, over time your vault turns into a choose your own adventure story. You can start at a specific place (i.e. your *Home* note), and navigate through your library using only the linked mentions displayed in the Local Graph.\n\nFor example, from my Home note, I may want to develop my general note on habits. I call this a *Map of Content* (or MOC, a term I picked up from Nick Milo of [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI)), and it has a few of the things from other notes that I consider important as well as a few opinion notes about the topic. Clicking on the *MOC - Habits* link from my *home* note takes me to that note and updates the Local Graph instantaneously:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianhabits.jpg)\n\nFrom here, I may want to review my notes on the book *[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=nosim\u0026tag=sweetsetup-20)* by James Clear. So clicking the *Atomic Habits* link takes me to that note, and again, the Local Graph is updated.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianatomichabits.jpg)\n\nWhile perusing my notes from the book, I come across a concept known as *Goodhart's Law*. This is a pretty important idea, so it actually has its own note that I can view from this page by again clicking the link.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidiangoodhartslaw.jpg)\n\nI've now gone several levels deep in landing on this idea that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. But what's really powerful about this is that it works both ways. I could have started at my *Goodhart's Law* note (maybe something reminded me of that note and I decided to look it up) and navigated my notes the other way as well. \n\nThe secret to making this work is to make *atomic notes*. The word atomic actually means \"of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.\" So an atomic note is one that can't be broken down any further, like my Goodhart's Law note. By having a bunch of smaller notes in your library, you have the building blocks for connecting and creating in new and powerful ways.\n\nIf you're used to keeping large notes and sorting them in folders, this can be a game-changer. Instead of having to drill down into your folder hierarchy or search for something specific, you can stumble upon the relevant information and jump across categories by using these bidirectional links to connect the atomic notes in your library. It does take a little more intentional effort when making notes, but the long-term payoff of being able to come at your ideas from multiple angles is worth it.\n\n*(If you want to know more about connecting notes and leveraging themf or future value, check out [[Connecting Notes \u0026 Bidirectional Linking]]).*","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Timeblocking-in-Obsidian":{"title":"","content":"\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/timeblockhero.jpg)\n\n[Obsidian](https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian/) is a great place to practice time blocking because you can link your time-blocked schedule to your daily note. In this video, we're going to walk you through how to set up time blocking in Obsidian using the *Daily Notes* Core plugin, and the *Day Planner* Community plugin. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is click the gear icon in the left sidebar to access the *Settings*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner1.jpg)\n\nNext, go to **Core Plugins** and make sure that the *Daily Notes* plugin is enabled. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner2.jpg)\n\nOnce the *Daily Notes* plugin is enabled, you'll see an additional icon in the left sidebar. Click on this icon to either create or open today's Daily Note. For example, this is the daily note for August 9, 2021. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner3.jpg)\n\nThis is a great place to capture any sort of information that we want to associate with today's date, including ideas with tasks that we need to do. It's also the perfect place to set our time blocked schedule using the *Day Planner* plugin. \n\n## Setting Up Day Planner\n\nGo back to the Settings menu and click **Community Plugins**, then click **Browse**. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner4.jpg)\n\nFrom the Community Plugins directory, search for *Day Planner*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner5.jpg)\n\nClick **Install** to install the plugin and **Enable** to turn it on. \n\nNext, close the plugins directory. Go to installed plugins and make sure that the *Day Planner* plugin is toggled on. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner6.jpg)\n\nNow *Day Planner* is ready to be used. By default, it keeps your day planner documents in a separate folder and we want to include these on our daily notes. So in the settings for the *Day Planner* plugin, change *File Mode* to *Command Mode*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner7.jpg)\n\nHere are the other recommended settings:\n\n- Complete past planner items: ON\n- Mermaid Gantt: OFF\n- Status Bar - Circular Progress: ON\n- Status Bar - Now \u0026 Next: ON\n- Task Notification: OFF\n- Task Zoom Level: LOW (all the way to the left)\n\nNow we're ready to use the day planner plugin. \n\n## Using Day Planner\n\nGo back to our daily notes and insert a *Day Planner* section  by hitting `Command-P` to open up the *Command Palette*. Search for `Day Planner` and select the bottom option *Day Planner: Add a Day Planner template for today to the current note*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner8.jpg)\n\nNext, plan out your day using 24 hour time formatting like so:\n\n```\n- [ ] 07:00 Morning Routine\n- [ ] 08:00 Meetings\n- [ ] 10:00 TSS Admin\n- [ ] 11:30 Weekly Standup\n- [ ] 12:00 Lunch\n- [ ] 13:00 Timeblocking Video\n- [ ] 15:00 Writing\n- [ ] 18:00 Soccer Practice\n- [ ] 20:00 Dinner\n```\n\nIn the Status Bar, we can see what we are working on right now: a circular chart indicating the progress of the current time block, and the next event on my time blocked plan. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner9.jpg)\n\nWe can also see a visualization of this by hitting `Command-P` to open up the *Command Palette* again and searching for `Day Planner`, then selecting *Show the Day Planner Timeline*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner10.jpg)\n\nOnce we do, the timeline opens in the right sidebar, giving us a visualization of our time blocked plan. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner11.jpg)\n\nWhen we have *Track Current Time* toggled on, the red bar will automatically adjust to the current time showing me only the appropriate information as we go about our day. ","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Turning-Obsidian-into-the-Perfect-Writing-App":{"title":"","content":"\nWhen I first started using Obsidian, I expected it would help me make connections between my notes and inspire new ideas. But over the last 12 months I've been using the app, I have also fallen in love with it as a writing tool. In fact, *I have written every article I've published in 2021 in Obsidian.*\n\nIn this post, I want to share a few tweaks that make Obsidian my perfect writing app.\n\n## My Journey Away from Ulysses\n\nLet me get this out right now: *Ulysses is an incredible writing app*.\n\nIt's just not for me for a couple specific reasons.\n\nFirst, publishing to the web isn't quite as easy as it should be with Ulysses. It does give you the ability to publish straight to Wordpress, and you can even update blog posts from Ulysses now - if you can get it to connect to your custom Wordpress blog.\n\nWhen this broke for me, I started digging in to how to fix it and quickly came across weird plugins and settings for modifying XMLRPC. And unfortunately, I could never get it functioning again. I fully understand it's something on my domains, but the \"simple instructions\" didn't work and even as a web developer I didn't feel comfortable digging too far into this.\n\nWhich meant I was stuck copying and pasting into Wordpress. And because Ulysses doesn't use standard Markdown, that meant I had to \"export\" my text first. Which works, but adds a few extra clicks or taps in order to get my text. Combine that with the fact that Ulysses has some weird Markdown formatting that never quite clicked for me in the first place, and I was left looking for a straight Markdown-based text editor.\n\nObsidian fits that description perfectly. It's simple, uses plain text files, provides inline formatting, and supports standard Markdown formatting. It's everything I've ever wanted in a plain text editor.\n\nBut there are a few additional settings and plugins you can use to make it even better as a writing app.\n\n## Obsidian Settings\n\nFirst, let's look at some of the settings. \n\nTo access these settings, click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner and then select *Editor* from the Settings sidebar.\n\nThe defaults are actually pretty good, but here's the key settings you want if you're going to use Obsidian for writing:\n\n- Make sure that **Auto pair Markdown syntax** is toggled **ON**. This creates both symbol and places the cursor in the middle, making it easier to create italicized or emphasized text.\n- Make sure **Smart indent lists** is toggled **ON**. This makes it easier to create bulleted and numbered lists quickly, automatically adding the next bullet when you hit the *Return* key.\n- Make sure that **Fold heading** and **Fold indent** are toggled **ON**. This creates carats for Markdown headers as well as indented text, adding some cool outliner-inspired features that make it easy to fold up text in large files and focus on the text you want.\n\nThere are a bunch of other settings you can customize, but may of them are simply personal preference. These are the important ones.\n\nOnce you have your settings, it's time to move on to the plugins.\n\n## Obsidian Core Plugin Settings\n\nThere are two types of plugins in Obsidian: *Core plugins* that ship with the app, and *Community plugins* that you can install to extend the functionality of Obsidian. We're going to look at the Core plugins first.\n\nHere are my recommendations for modifying the Core plugins:\n\n- Make sure that **Backlinks** and **Outgoing Links** are both toggled **ON**. These are sections available in the right sidebar that show all of the notes that link to the active note and all of the notes linked to from the active note respectively. (If you're new to the concept of connected notes, check out [this article on using the local graph](https://thesweetsetup.com/the-power-of-obsidians-local-graph/).)\n- Make sure that **Outline** is toggled **ON**. This adds a tab in the right sidebar that creates a table of contents for your note based on the Markdown headers. This is helpful when you need to jump to a specific section of a longer text as you can do so simply by clicking on the appropriate header title.\n- Turn the**Word Count** setting **OFF**. Word counts are important, but there's a Community plugin that does this *much* better than the built-in word count tool here.\n\nAgain, there are a bunch of options here that are personal preference but these are the important ones. Once you have these Core plugins set, it's time to add some Community plugins.\n\n## Obsidian Community Plugins for an Upgraded Writing Experience\n\nYou can access the Community plugins public directory by going to *Settings --\u003e Community plugins --\u003e Browse* once you've toggled off *Safe Mode*. From there, you can find plugins for just about anything, from [embedding tasks from Todoist](https://thesweetsetup.com/syncing-embedding-tasks-from-todoist-in-obsidian/) to [creating timeblocked daily plans](https://thesweetsetup.com/timeblocking-in-obsidian/) to [creating kanban boards](https://thesweetsetup.com/my-obsidian-based-kanban-writing-workflow/) - all based off plain text files using standard Markdown.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/communityplugins.jpg)\n\nNote that many of the plugins I will share here are replacements for standard features in Ulysses, so if you don't mind non-standard Markdown formatting and don't run into the publishing issues that I did maybe try that instead. But if you're all in with Obsidian, here are the plugins I use to make Obsidian my perfect writing app.\n\n### Better Word Count\n\nThe first plugin is called [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count). This replaces the built-in word count core plugin, but adds a few more options and features (for example, the ability to add the daily words written).\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/betterwordcount.jpg)\n\nHere are the settings I recommend for this:\n\n- Make sure that **Collect Statistics** is toggled **ON**. This is required for the daily word count statistic.\n- Turn **Select a Preset** to **Custom**. This allows you to create your own stats formatting in the status bar. I use `w: {word_count} c: {character_count} dw: {words_today}` which gives me the words and characters in the current document, plus the total words written today.\n\n(Note that you may need to force reload Obsidian before the stats show up in your status bar. You can do this by quitting and reopening the app or selecting *View --\u003e Force Reload*.)\n\nIt's not as good as the writing stats in Ulysses, but it's good enough for me.\n\n### Reading Time\n\nAnother handy Ulysses feature is being able to see how long it will take to read the text in the selected file. But you can add this feature to the status bar using the [Reading Time](https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time) plugin.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readingtime.jpg)\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward - just install it and turn it on and you'll see the reading time at the bottom of your Obsidian window. You can customize your reading speed however in the settings for the plugin.\n\n### Footnote Shortcut\n\nIf you use footnotes a lot, they can be a bit of a pain to create via standard Markdown. But it's a lot easier with the [Obsidian Footnotes](https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-footnotes) plugin.\n\nOnce installed, you can a command and hotkey is added for *Footnote Shortcut: Insert and Navigate Footnote*. You can customize the hotkey by going to *Settings --\u003e Hotkey* and searching for *Footnote*, which will then insert the appropriate Markdown and navigate to the bottom of the note where you can insert the text for your footnote.\n\n### Focus Mode\n\nThe Obsidian interface can be a little distracting when you're trying to focus on your words. Fortunately, the [Focus Mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode) plugin allows you to remove all the distractions and focus on what you're writing.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/focusmode.jpg)\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and active, just click the *Toggle Focus Mode* button to hide the sidebars and status bar, and you can shift-click the button to hide everything but the active writing pane. \n\n*(If you want more plugin recommendations, check out [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]]).*","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Using-Obsidian-on-iOS":{"title":"","content":"\nThere's a bit of a note-taking revolution happening, and at the epicenter is a concept called *bidirectional linking*. It's a fundamentally different approach to linked notes in that the link only needs to exist on one of the notes is order for the connection to be active from both directions. For example, let's say I have a link from *Note 1* to *Note 2*. In the past, I would be able to travel from *Note 1* to *Note 2* by clicking on the link, but I wouldn't be able to get back without a separate link from *Note 2* to *Note 1*. *Bidirectional linking* solves this by providing a two-way link between notes, even if there is only a single link between them.\n\nThis idea has been incorporated by a bunch of popular note-taking apps lately. Roam Research, Craft, and my beloved Obsidian are just a few of the apps that have implemented some version of bidirectional linking. But what makes Obsidian unique (and appealing to Mac nerds like me) is that it simply sits on top of Markdown-formatted plain text files. \n\nIt also offers a lot of customization through plugins that you can use to extend the capabilities of the application. These plugins allow you to turn Obsidian into a digital Bullet Journal, the ultimate writing app, or even a kanban board for project management. Just click a button and you can install a third-party plugin that significantly alters what Obsidian is capable of.\n\nThe magic happens in Obsidian as a result of the combination of these three features (bidirectional linking, Markdown-formatted text files, and third-party plugin support). While this appeared feasible on the desktop, being able to combine all of these in an App Store approved iOS app seemed like an impossible task.\n\nBut just a few short weeks ago, Obsidian released an official iOS app through the App Store. And it includes everything that makes Obsidian great.\n\n## The Interface\n\nGetting the entire Obsidian interface onto the small screen of an iPhone  is no small feat. For example, the main Obsidian interface has three section:\n- The left sidebar, which includes the File Explorer and Search\n- The main Editor window\n- The right sidebar (which includes backlinks, tags, etc.)\n\nAnd it's all there on the iPhone.\n\nBoth of the sidebars are available via swipe gestures , giving you access to the entire Obsidian interface without cluttering up your iPhone screen.\n\n## The Features\n\n*ALL* of the features of Obsidian on the desktop are here, and it's kind of incredible when you think about it. The Graph View, Quick Switcher, keyboard shortcuts - everything. And not only is it all here, but it's  implemented in a way that makes sense on a smaller touch interface. For example, there's a feature on iOS called *Quick Action* that is activated by swiping down anywhere on the screen (except the top of your device, which opens Notifications or Control Center). You can assign this to any action you want, but by default it opens the Command Palette - which feels only natural since it's kind of Spotlight for Obsidian and the swipe gesture is the same one you use to access Spotlight from the Home Screen.\n\nThere's also a mobile toolbar above the onscreen keyboard that gives you access to many common actions. These can not only help you do things quickly in the app but also serve as a great Markdown reference tool.  If you're coming from an app like Evernote and haven't written in plain text before, this is a wonderful security blanket.\n\n## The Plugins\n\nEven the community plugins are here, though there is a caveat - not every community plugin will work (or work correctly) on the mobile version. The plugin developers may have to add or modify code to make their plugins work correctly, so if you have 30 community plugins installed don't expect them all to work flawlessly right away. A good number of them will, but I've encountered a few that I rely on which still need some TLC.\n\n## Sync\n\nThis is one of the most interesting things about the iOS app.\n\nObsidian is actually a completely free app for both macOS and iOS. The pricing model is based on two premium core plugins, one of which is *Sync*. The service from Obsidian is currently $4 USD per month, and offers end-to-end encryption and 1 year of revision history.\n\nBut, remember, Obsidian simply sits on top of plain text files. So when you open up the iOS app for the first time, you're prompted to create a vault inside of your Obsidian folder on iCloud Drive. For example, if you create a vault on Obsidian for iOS called \"Notes\" it will live in `iCloud Drive\\Obsidian\\Notes` on your Mac. This allows you to sync all of your files via iCloud Drive, and even opens up some interesting automation possibilities with Shortcuts and the Files app.\n\nThat means that you can get it all - bidirectional linking, Markdown-based text files, plugins, even sync - for free.\n\nWhich means there really is no reason not to give connected note-taking a try.","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Using-Templates-in-Obsidian":{"title":"","content":"\nTemplates in Obsidian are a great way to jumpstart creating a new note. In this post, we're going to show you how to set up and use a couple different types of templates in Obsidian. If you'd like to see it in action, here's a short video from our upcoming PKM course.\n\n## Daily Notes Templates\n\nThe first type of template is a *Daily Notes template*. This is my daily notes template:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates1.jpg)\n\nThis is just a note in my Obsidian library. To use use a note like this as your daily notes template, go to the *Settings --\u003e Core Plugins* and make sure that the *Daily Notes* plugin is activated. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates2.jpg)\n\nOnce activated, configure the settings for the Daily Notes plugin and make sure you have both the new file location set and the template file location. For example, my template file location is *Templates/Daily Notes Template*. \n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates3.jpg)\n\nNow when we click the button to create a new Daily Note, it pre-populates the new note with our templated text:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates4.jpg)\n\n## General Templates\n\nIn addition to the Daily Notes template, you can use templates anywhere in Obsidian when creating a new note by activating the *Templates* core plugin. Go to *Settings --\u003e Core Plugins* and make sure that the *Templates* plugin is activated as well as the *Command Palette* plugin (what you'll use to insert the templates).\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates5.jpg)\n\nNext, go to the settings for the *Templates* plugin and set the folder that will contain your templates (mine is set to the *Templates* folder). Once you have your template files created, you can insert a template into a new note by opening the Command Palette with *Command-P* and selecting *Insert Template* (you can also use the keyboard shortcut *Command-T*).\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates6.jpg)\n\nChoose the template file you want to open, and the text from the template file gets inserted into your new note.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates7.jpg)","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/Writing":{"title":"","content":"I want to...\n\n- Make Obsidian feel more like Ulysses: [[Turning Obsidian into the Perfect Writing App]]\n- Manage writing projects with kanban boards: [[Mike's Obsidian-Based Writing Workflow]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null},"/Gr.-10/Starter/YAML-Dataview":{"title":"","content":"\nDataview is an incredibly powerful plugin that allows you to filter data in your obsidian vault in a lot of really cool ways. In this post, I'm going to show you how I use it to create a table of book ratings from YAML metadata.\n\nDont' worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds. Here's a post that walks you through the whole process.\n\n## How Dataview works\n\nThe best way to explain the [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) is to show an example. One of the ways I use it is to create a table of all of the ratings from the [Bookworm podcast](https://bookworm.fm/) that I do with [Joe Buhlig](https://thesweetsetup.com/how-joe-buhligs-shabbat-helps-him-stay-intentional/). We read a book every two weeks, we talk about what we got out of it, and we give the book a rating. And using Dataview, I can compile all of the ratings into a table.\n\nSo to start, I have a note in my Obsidian Vault for every single episode of bookworm. To add the rating, I simply add the YAML frontmatter metadata in Edit Mode like so:\n\n```\n---\n(your YAML text)\n---\n```\n\nHere's what it looks like side-by-side in Edit Mode and Preview Mode:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview1.jpg)\n\nIn this particular example, I have a 3 pieces of metadata:\n\n1. The tag *bookworm*\n2. Joe's Rating (4.0)\n3. My rating (4.0)\n\n(In the podcast, we rate books from one to five stars, similar to the Amazon ratings. So this particular book, Joe gave it a 4 stars, and I gave it a 4 stars.) \n\nNow from this point, we're going to create a new note and use the Dataview plugin to create a table of all of these ratings in the new note. So the first thing we need to do is to install the Dataview plugin.\n\nTo install the plugin, click the Gear to access the Settings:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview2.jpg)\n\nThen go to *Community Plugins* and click *Browse*:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview3.jpg)\n\nSearch the Dataview plugin. Once you find it, click *Install* and then *Enable*.\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview4.jpg)\n\nNote that in the plugin description, they give you a lot of other examples on how you might want to use this.\n\nNow we can close the Settings and go back to our new note, *Bookworm Ratings*, and add the following code:\n\n```dataview\ntable Joe, Mike\nfrom \"Bookworm\"\nsort Mike desc\n```\n\nThe three backticks are the Obsidian formatting for code snippets, and everything inside is telling the Dataview plugin what to do. Here's a description of what's going on here:\n\n- ```dataview``` tells Obsidian to use the Dataview plugin\n- table Joe, Mike tells Dataview to create a table with values from Joe \u0026 Mike from the YAML section of the desired files\n- from \"Bookworm\" tell Dataview to include all files from the *Bookworm* folder\n- sort Mike desc says to sort everything in descending order by the values in the Mike column\n\nThat's all we have to do. Now when we click the Preview button, Dataview will render a table of ratings based on the values in the YAML metadata. Here's a side-by-side screenshot of the code in Edit Mode and the table in Preview Mode:\n\n![](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview5.jpg)\n\nBut this is just one example of how you might use this incredible plugin. There are lots of other great examples over at the [Obdisian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-plugin-snippet-showcase/13673) if you need some additional inspiration. \n\n*(If you want more plugin recommendations, check out [[A Few of Our Favorite Obsidian Plugins]]).*","lastmodified":"2022-06-27T00:02:30.178383986Z","tags":null}}
