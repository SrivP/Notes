What do you think about while listening to it?\n\t- It brings to mind this idea of moving forward with life, at first it sounds like a poem describing a desolate landscape, but when you look into it more, you start to notice that it's more about moving on. Because like when the author uses words like How charged with punishments the scroll, it comes to mind that punishments are warranted when you did something wrong. But in the final line, where he states \"I am master of my fate, I am captain of my soul\", it gives us this sense of moving forward.\n3. Where did you mind go?\n\t- My mind went to a dark room, a place where one can reflect on their past, without distraction\n4. Has anything been said in the poem to remind you of something in your life?\n\t- TBD\n5. Do we talk about imagery for this one or no?\n\n6. Does the poet bring up ideas you'd like to ask him/her about?\n\t- I've always had this idea of guilt and forgiveness, they're polar opposities, but they share a symbiotic relationship. If you are guilty, you need to forgive yourself to let go of the guilt, but if you're forgiving too much, then it can cause guilt in others. For example, if you snuck in a few cookies from the cookie jar without telling your parents, you feel guilty (sometimes), so to move on, would be to tell your parents, or \"forgive yourself\" and move on. But lets take for example, you are on a diet, and you eat a cookie. It goes against your diet, you forgive yourself, but that will make you want to do it again. That will make you more guilty. Its a weird relationship. But they relate together. So i would like to ask the author, how should one move on from the problems they face and forgive without guilt?.\n \n ","lastmodified":"2022-06-05T20:38:02.02008354Z","tags":null},"/Trial/Questions":{"title":"Questions","content":"\n- \n- ## Questions for English\n\t- Is my thesis statement effective:\n\t- xMark Anthony has many features of a skilled politician, including his power of irony and rhetorical speech, his persuasive abilities and his flexible mindset.\n\t\t-\n\t\t-\n\t\t-\n- Are my points for Mark Anthony valid?:\n\t- Anthony's Presence of mind in a given situation\n\t- Anthony has a flexible and open mindset allowing him to quickly switch sides when needed, allowing him to connect to other on a deeper level - can't say that, say he is easily adaptable\n\t-\n\t- Anthony demonstrates ironic and rhetoric abilities, allowing him to speak his mind, without affecting anyone, or affecting his public image\n\t  These points are what demonstrate Anthony as a strong politician throughout the play.\\\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n- Also for my theme in the poem, would Self-Acceptance work?, because it works its way into the short story and the book, and Brutus's internal conflict is a good example for the poem\n- Do all our poems have to be from the website you linked?\n-\n- For the first question, do we have to give an explanation with our quote for each unit, or just the quote on the poem?.\n- Post apocolyptic theme\n- Mis conception theme\n- Dream theme\n- #+BEGIN_TIP\n  Weakness or powerlessness / Self acceptance\n  #+END_TIP\n-\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-05T20:38:02.02008354Z","tags":null}}
