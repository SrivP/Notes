# Intro
- Java is an object oriented programming language
- It consists of 2 main aspects, objects and classes
- Objects are basically going to be the actual application of the program 
- Classes are going to be the ones that define the attributes of an object
- It can be inferred that classes are user-defined data types implemented using the primitive data types e.g. `boolean`, `int`, `char` etc.

## Analogy
> So its kinda like a light bulb, where the object is the light bulb and the class is going to be the attribute or the "blueprint" of the light bulb!
