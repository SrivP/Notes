- A function, in mathematics, is basically **an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another variable (the dependent variable)**.

- Function =

- y = f(x) meaning the value of y is equal to the fucntion value of x
  
- Function Vs. Equation
	- A function has at least 2 variables: an output variable and one or more input variables.
	- An equation states that two expressions are equal, and it may involve any number of variables (none, one, or more).
	- Kinda like an equation is used to define function
	- Equation is like the building block of functions
