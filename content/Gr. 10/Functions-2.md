# The Basics
- A function, in mathematics, is basically **an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another variable (the dependent variable)**.

- Function =

- y = f(x) meaning the value of y is equal to the fucntion value of x
  
- Function Vs. Equation
	- A function has at least 2 variables: an output variable and one or more input variables.
	- An equation states that two expressions are equal, and it may involve any number of variables (none, one, or more).
	- Kinda like an equation is used to define function
	- Equation is like the building block of functions


# How to derive a function from an equation
1. If we're given an equation 
	- -2x + 5 = 2y - 6
2. And a function is written in words: f(x)  = (y)
3.  And you are asked to express the function in the form of input (in terms of x in this case)
4. We have to understand that we have to isolate the output value (y) and the equation on the other side is considered the function!
5. So,

6. Therefore, the function f is defined as follows:
	- f(x) = -x + $\frac{11}{2}$

 # Domain Expansion (Jujutsu Kaisen lol)
 - The domain of a function is basically all inputs over which the function can produce an output/has an output for
 ![R8ppcj.png](https://imgpile.com/images/R8ppcj.png)
 - Examples &uarr;
 ![R8pSBo.png](https://imgpile.com/images/R8pSBo.png)
 - Another really good example, if the function only takes 2 possible input, then that is the domain!
 -  All parabolas that open at the top or bottom are considered functions (ones that open on the left and right are not functions)

 - &uarr; Function
 - &darr; Not a Function

 # Range
 - All possible outputs of a given function
 ![R8SIEw.png](https://imgpile.com/images/R8SIEw.png)
 - For example if domain is all real #'s, then range in all real number that are greater than 0!
 - (I still don't get that lol: https://cutt.ly/VKLlgNB)

# Analogy
- So basically if we have to find the domain and range of a graph
	- For domain we would look at the lowest and highest **x** coordinate values
	- For range we would look at the lowest and highest **y** coordinate values
	- If we are given only a few dots in the graph, then we conclude that those dots are the only valid input/output for the function, and we just state those dots without considering the values in between.
	- The domain and range with values in between can be denoted as so: *Lowest* **$\le$**  *x*  **$\le$** *Highest* 
 - [--] denotes including the numbers in the set
 - (--) denotes this set, but without including the number listed (so like one less)
