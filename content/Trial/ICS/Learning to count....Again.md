- Binary = Base 2
	- ![RsZjuP.png](https://imgpile.com/images/RsZjuP.png)
	- A single digit of binary is called a bit, it's ONLY 1 or 0
	- Each value in a table is worth 1, is 1 - 128 in the table is 8 bits.
	- Computers use Binary system

		- Decimal #'s get grouped by 3 digits
		- Binary #'s get grouped by 4 digits
- Octal = Base 8
	- Use 8 values to represent numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
	- Similar to decimal column system
		- Conversion technique:

		- Used in early systems
		- To go from base 8 to base 2, have to do till base 10 first
			- Base 10 - Base 8:
