> Do page 41 Q.10+ & Go over 6 Trig ratios + Triangle SAS, SSS, AAA, Properties of Triangles. Check for answer.
- Congruent Triangles: are triangles that are the same in every aspect, (equal side lengths and equal angles) 
- Similar Triangles: are triangles that have same shape and equal angles but not necessarily same size

## Properties of a Triangle:
- (AAA) Relation. If corresponding angles are equal

- If side A on triangle A over side B on triangle B = 1/2. Then the others should follow the same ratios. 
- So 2 corresponding and 1 same angle means SAS right?

- Nothing to really explain here?
